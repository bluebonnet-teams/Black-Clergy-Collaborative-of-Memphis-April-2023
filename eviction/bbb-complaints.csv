About a month after moving, I received a collections letter for almost $800. When I called to inquire with Indigo about the charges, they could not explain them and said they would call me back. I never received a call back, and have attempted to make contact several times and no one will answer my calls. I have now received notice that this debt will be reported to my credit, but I am uncomfortable paying so much money for unexplained charges. I would like for the management to call and explain these charges, or for the debt to be cleared and any damage to my credit be rectified.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/apartments/indigo-riverview-0543-44182146

I am rejecting this response because: The rent is actually due on the 1st of every month but your system has a delay in collection automatic bill pays. I called your office on May 3rd 2022 and spoke with ******* and asked if I needed to make a manual payment or if I should allow for the automatic bill pay to push through. She informed me to wait because she didn't want me to be billed twice and said nothing about the $2,000 limit at the time. Then the 4th came and I had a late fee. I called the office again, and spoke with ******* she had me come down to the office so that we could figure out what happened. She discovered it's because there was a limit set at $2,000 - our monthly rent is $1865 mind you. She said she would fix it since she was the one that told us not to pay it the day prior. 
Then again on our LAST month of living their your team sends out an email saying that your system is being updated or changed and to bring a check to the office. Then later send out another message that everything is fine and autopay's should work as normal. All of a sudden surprise surprise our autopay is removed from the system and we're charged a late fee on the 4th of April. I asked for a courtesy removal removal because of the issues with YOUR systems. No one sets up autopay to pay 12/13 months and ignore the last month of living there. Then because management has changed and ******* didn't place any notes in your system it looks like I didn't pay my bill on time. The new manager *** and the lady at the front desk ***** basically tell me to kick rocks because it's not their problem. Your team needs to reevaluate your payment systems, place better notes on tenant accounts, and take a look at the customer service provided on site.

I am rejecting this response because: They are correct all repairs were made but yes it took a while my ceiling was down for a whole month and attracted spiders and more it got fixed two days before My apartment flooded. I will not go back and forth about this and I will speak with them but far as my son , I was honest about that whole situation and never denied anything but it was more than just him , further more while is he being put on the bar list while the other occupants that were with him is 18 as well and he is in his last year of high school. All my children are on my lease and my son just turned 18 last after I renewed my lease. So no I do not agree. If I was in violation of lease why was I not evicted. No they are they trying to cover themselves because of this. I spoke with ebony just yesterday and we spoke about this issue and she said would check the lease. I had no plans to renew my lease but due to the fact I had Covid 19 and I was affected by it I fell behind and she filed on me. Now because of this  judgment alone From ******************** everyone is denying me even though  my account was paid in full. I am Christian ***** and it takes a lot to get me  upset but something has to be done. So I pray God steps in this situation because this is not fair.

I immediately called in an urgent maintenance request having to leave a message. I went outside to inspect, I could hear water ******* through the walls down to a storageroom below and outside the driveways down to the parking lot. It was tons of water. While outside, I ran into my neighbor, who told me her unit was also flooding and had been since around 1 pm (2+hrs). She explained she had called emergency maintenance and the office 20+ times and had not received any feedback in hours. After waiting nearly anhour for maintenance to call me back, I jumped in my car, risking my life riding on ice to search for someone to help. I was able to find a maintenance person to trail me and cut off the water. My family and pets packed up to leave for the rest of the weekend. Understanding it was the Christmas holiday, I waited until Tuesday the following week to return to check on my unit. I found that no one had been out. Within those 4 days, I had not received a call or email from ******* Staff or Fogelman. The same day, I went to the leasing office and found that the office was closed down due to damage from the storm.Between 12/24 and 01/03/23, I repeatedly called and emailed ******************** Staff and Fogelman. I did not receive any direct contact back until I reached out to Code Enforcement. After 12 days, my neighborsadvised water was restored to our building and we returned home.I waited a few days expecting to hear back from staff regarding scheduling to have the walls fixed and the damaged/mildewed carpet removed. I was never contacted. 01/10/23, I emailed ****************************** detailing the ordealI had already been through and asking for an update on repairs needed. Finally, I received a response, I was given a half apology along with multiple excuses as to why no one had contacted me in 17 days. I was given a credit on my lease for the days I was away and told I would get an update on repairs later.No one ever contacted me back. During this time, men from the restoration team (strangers) were randomly entering apt without any notice every other day. On 01/13/23, a man came to inspect, he advised my apt would be demolished soon. He explained they were planning to tear the wall out. To reiterate, ******************** had not provided any updates to me. NONE. I reached out (via email as I could never reach anyone in person or over the phone) asking for them to advise what construction would be done and when itwould start. I was told (via email), they were waiting on insurance adjusters etc before they could update me with any info.On Jan 20th, multiple people came in, advising they would start the demo in 10mins. I was given 10mins to gather belongings and leave. When I returned later that evening the entire front half of my apt had been gutted. The front entry, kitchen, hallway, bedroom, living room, and sunroom was nothing but wood frame. This is when I realized I had been moved into a unit that already had extensive mold and mildew issues. Also, without warning the water was turned off so there was no water, no heat so my family and I could not stay. I again gave my apts time to send out an update or call but I got nothing. On 01/23/23, I emailed again. This time detailing my extreme dissatisfactionregarding not being notified of demolitionetc. Fogelman reached out (via email) letting me know that basically, they were too busy to help me or contact me due to their multiple properties affected by the storm and the millions of dollars they expect to be out of. She let me know that if I was so unsatisfied she would release me from my lease.

Fogelman Properties is in receipt of the above referenced customers complaint and appreciates the opportunity to respond. 

Like many others in the metro Atlanta area and around the country,************ and several of her neighbors experienced a water leak in their apartments after the unprecedented and extreme cold temperatures during the Christmas holiday weekend caused a water line to freeze and rupture.  On the night of the water leaks, our property team members and the fire department responded to the property immediately, turned off the water supply to prevent further water damage, and assisted as many affected residents as possible. 
As you can imagine, the magnitude of the damage (regionally and nationally) caused by the extreme cold temperatures, especially during holiday celebrations, placed an enormous strain on the availability of resources.  Nevertheless, unlike many other properties, our property team was able to find an emergency response company to begin water extraction and drying that night.  However, because of the large number of impacted apartments, and the limited resources (personnel and equipment)available to address those many impacted apartments, some apartments, including Ms. ****** could not be immediately addressed. Still, as soon as additional personnel and equipment arrived, the repairs in Ms. ***** apartment commenced and continue. 

Unfortunately, the damage to Ms. ***** home was so substantial that ************ must vacate her apartment while the repairs are completed.  Currently, our community only has two available vacant apartments, and ************ was offered the opportunity to move to one of those, but she did not accept that offer.  Because there are no other relocation options within our community, ************ was instructed to vacate her apartment so that necessary repairs could be completed over the next few months.  We regret this was necessary, but we made this decision after determining it was in the best interest of Ms. ***** comfort and wellbeing.

************ has spoken to our onsite property management team and messaged with a representative from our corporate office on several occasions, and they have explained the magnitude of freeze damage in our community and the Atlanta area and the challenges weve encountered.  Members of our team have also assisted *********** with her renters insurance claim by speaking with her insurance agent.  We understand and are sympathetic with Ms. ***** frustration with the unavoidable and unfortunate circumstances she is facing, and our team has made every reasonable effort to respond to and address Ms. ***** concerns.

I got the information from leasing office that, cabinet attached to wall, and bottom of the cabinet got wet. This is because internal leakage of apartment pipes behind the walls, which is usually not found by an external person. This leak is so small, no one can identify until it's removed. This is an apartment structural issue, and laying charges on me. This is unethical, and how am I responsible for this charge? 2. Kitchen countertop next to sink ( $ 625): If we replace the top layer, and two wooden planks, wouldn't cost this much, and they are upgrading the unit and laying the cost on me. I need justice on these exorbitant charges, not sure if this is happening because I'm an immigrant. I have attached images for kitchen damage, and master bath damage when I moved out.

None of the damages charged at move out are normal wear and tear or are notes on the move in inspection. There was severe waster damage to the kitchen countertops and cabinet on the sink side of the kitchen. As you can see in the photos, it is warped and sunken in. So much water had sat there that it disintegrated the wood under the laminate, causing it to sink. This piece of counter could not be salvaged. There was also severe water damage under the kitchen cabinet where it appears the water that was seeping down from the top of the counter was eroding the cabinet box bottom. We were able to replace this in-house and did not have to replace the whole cabinet. When our Assistant Manager walked the unit at move out with Mr. ***** he said he never notices any of these damages and dismissed her. She informed him that he would be charged for these items. He was charged the depreciated rate. The master bathroom had severe water damage to the vanity and flooring. The leak Mr. ***** is referring to in his statement was a leak under the toilet that was only visible on the ceiling in the unit downstairs. There was no water reported or able to be seen from Mr. ******* apartment. As seen in the photos, there is severe damage to the vanity and it had to be replaced (invoice attached). Consumer Response /* (3000, 7, 2021/12/23) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) I don't agree with the response from Legacy Farm apartments. Master bath leak was not visible to outside, as it was internally leaking, our downstairs complained about leak, and Legacy Farms didn't fix it permanently for their complaint, as the leak diverted to other side ( as it appears). We are not responsible if some leak happens behind the walls. Attached are the requests created by downstairs about the leak, it was not fixed permanently. These charges for apartment internal structural issues ( small leaks) to me are not an ethical business practice. This is what I didn't agree with assistant business manager. Regarding kitchen sink issue, next to sink, granite layer was swelled, it needs granite sheet, and wood under that sheet. Cabinet under the sheet is working fine, as assistant manager saw it. Under the sink a wood plank is needed to replace. They replaced the whole kitchen cabinets because of their plans to upgrade the unit, and attribute the charges on me. Instead of fixing , what's the reason for replacing. Business Response /* (4000, 9, 2021/12/29) */ We realize that **** ***** ***** is not accepting of our company's response. We however stand firm on our comments and documentation in this matter. No amendment to the final charges will be made. Business Response /* (4000, 13, 2022/01/11) */ Attached is the lease agreement for **** ***** *****. Clause 49 is highlighted for review.

New potential tenants only get to see the Model/Demo unit. It's beautiful. So I anticipated that my own unit would be the same. I was very excited to move here. But, Move in day was a NIGHTMARE! I made the visit and I signed the lease at the end of October for a unit that would be available by early December. My move in date was set for December 14th. After I signed, I had not heard anything from the complex. I reached out on Dec 6 for any updates since the move in date was fast approaching. I asked if I could do a walk through prior to move in date. I was told by **** *** that they had not yet started working inside the unit.

Thanks **** *** Fast forward to Dec 14. I could not go in to pick up the key and welcome packet until after 4:00pm. When I arrived, the leasing agent asked if I wanted her to bring me to my unit. On move in day - Once we get to the unit, we drove around the garage and park in the street. ******* says that I do not have a garage key, they ran out she says. So I cannot use the garage to drive into when i return home. I have to wait until they get more garage remotes. I am also told that the alarm system in the unit is not yet activated, it will take a week or two before someone comes out to activate it. But I am still being charged. I probably could have gotten past these minor mishaps if this were the just of all the move in issues. BUT THE MOST DISTURBING issue of all is the condition of the apartment itself. I almost cannot find the appropriate words to adequately explain. Yes, they did change the carpets and floors. And painted the walls. But, this did not help the overall makeup of the unit. It should not have been offered in that condition. It smelled clammy and of perspiration. It smelled of MOLD! The bathroom molding was hideous and separating from the walls. As if the tubs had been leaking and water seeped through the floors and walls.The mirrors in the bathrooms were repugnant and looked like someone took a hammer and beat up the edges.The cabinets looked excessively worn and should be trashed! TRASHED! All of them!! Especially the bathroom cabinets.The lighting is horrible. Before I walked into the unit, the screen on the window fell off as we approached the front door. I felt like I would be moving into someone else's filth. And honestly should not have passed inspection, to deliver to a new tenant, if there was one done. As **** **** noticed and acknowledged my disappointment. I desperately asked, ""What can we do about all this..."" And all she could offer was that maintenance was busy working on other units and would not be in a rush to get to me again to fix anything.

Problems with Product/Service,1590525124,Answered,08/02/2020,Initial Complaint,"Fogelman refuses to return our application fee even though we could not see the unit due to COVID. We understand that Fogelman has policies in place regarding the showing of properties and the application process. However, you have not taken into account (in totality) the customer and their needs during these challenging times. In my opinion, Fogelman has taken advantage of its current policy by not showing properties to prospective tenants, but insiting that they have to apply in order to be eligible to obtain a lease agreement to a rental unit. This is unethical and we deserve a refund of our deposit money. On May 13, 2020, my wife and I applied for an apartment at a Fogelman property ************** ********* We were approaching the end of our lease at our current residence and needed to find an alternate place to live that would able to provide us with the comforts of a safe and comfortable home. The employees in the office at the ***************** were very cordial and nice on the phone. They informed us that there were limited units left with the size and location standards that we preferred and needed. In addition, they informed us that it would be best if we applied for the property ahead of time even though we WOULD NOT be allowed TO SEE the property until the current tenants moved out. This placed us in a stressful situation because, FOGELMAN required that we give them money just apply for an apartment that they would not let us see. They insisted that we look at the property via pictures. This would be ok except that we are looking for someplace to live and does not provide the opportunity to review other aspects of the property such as access to the detail quality of the unit, hallways, and the ability to see the overall quality and feel of the property. This also would have been ok, IF Fogelman would not have demanded an application fee just to ensure that we were in line to be able to obtain the unit. This policy takes advantage of people in our situation by requiring that we pay an application fee, while not giving us the opportunity to see the property and thus potentially loose our hard earned money. Attached is the receipt from this unethical transaction that we had to participate in in order to be able to potentially move into the property. Once we were finally able to see the property in person, we discovered a couple of personal reasons for why we would not be comfortable moving into this property. These were all items/reasons that are not able to be seen/felt from a picture. Normally a prospective tenant would simply just not apply to stay in the property. However, due to COVID and our need to find a new place quickly, that was not presented as an option to us and we feel that Fogelman has taken advantage of that. Therefore, we requested our $500 deposit back. Fogelman denied our refund based on their standard policy. We don't disagree with that policy IF the situation can proceed as normal (NON-COVID times). However, Fogleman has taken advantage of people (my wife and I) in our situation by not giving the prospective tenant a means to obtain their money simply back because they can not show the property due to COVID. Although we were extremely disappointed, we don't think the Fogelman management truly understands the nature of this denial or the perception of Fogelman properties that it leaves with us. We do not own any real estate in Tennessee but we our landlords and understand the importance of working with tenants and prospective tenants. We would like to request that Fogelman reconsider the unethical nature of this policy during this (COVID-19) time and refund us back our $500. We understand Fogelman has relatively strong ties to the Memphis area and would only want the best for it and its potential tenants. Can you please show us this appreciation for our interest in a Fogelman property and refund us our deposit fee.

My wife and I would like to look at the unit before actually physically moving in just to make sure we're comfortable. Its tough since we are all living with COVID right now. I suppose we could do that on the 17th of July after all the documentation is completed? And lastly of course we still want to consider a two bedroom or larger if it becomes available by July 31. Thanks again so much ******! ******* Consumer Response /* (3000, 7, 2020/08/06) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) We have not filed a complaint because we were not aware of the policy in place by Fogleman Properties. We have filed a complaint because the policy is not a fair policy during COVID-19. When we requested that we receive a refund for the deposit, ****** kindly looked into it and told us she would ask her colleagues at Fogleman to try and help us obtain our money back. We appreciated her help with that. ****** informed us that her colleagues (or supervision or whoever she asked at Fogleman) refused to accept our request even though we could not see the property due to COVID. So we want to be clear on why the complaint has been filed. This response only says that we knew about the policy which is in place regardless of COVID-19 or No COVID-19. It makes sense and is easy and practical for all during a NON COVID-19 scenario. However, during COVID-19, it is NOT. That, combined with whoever******* talked to at Fogleman who would not agree to refund us our money due to the COVID-19 situation is why we have filed this complaint. This response suggests that we filed the complaint because of the policy only. Please re-read the complaint. Please understand WHY we have the complaint. Business Response /* (4000, 9, 2020/08/07) */ An amendment of our policy is not warranted. ******** viewed the unit and contacted the property a week later stating ""it wouldn't work for them"". He then inquired about a refund. He was given the option to select a larger unit, but the deposit is not refundable. Our policy has remained consistent with all communities and we stand by it.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/property-management/fogelman-properties-inc-0543-1144

She essentially wants us to renovate the entire bathroom which is not a reasonable accommodation at this point.

Problems with Product/Service,1592241044,Answered,07/01/2022,Business response,"We apologize for the delay in response on this complaint.  Envolve Communities purchased these properties in 2019 and we have been working to make sure all residents have been properly qualified since we purchased the properties.  As such, the re-qualification processes may have changed since this resident moved in many years ago and has renewed over the years that they have lived at this property.  Due to the requirements from HUD and all of the programs on site, there are many requirements for exact documentation and items that we must receive and verify in order to renew leases and re-qualify residents every year.  The below items outline what the manager has encountered in an effort to work towards qualifying this resident and renew their lease this year.
-We were working to get *************** re-certified and she was very difficult to deal with throughout the whole process.
-She was very resistant to provide any required documentation and her argument was that she has never had to provide any of these documents before so why should she now - again we have to follow rules and require specific documentation based on HUD and program guidelines
-She thought we were trying to steal her information because a copy of her Chime card was required to validate the account number with the balance (which she would not provide)
-She requested a checklist of what was needed and we provided her with one. She said it wasnt valid because it had our letter head on it and she wanted one from HUD. Manager printed out all of the relevant documents from  HUD but she refused to come get them from office.  Manager attempted to go to her unit to explain them to her but she refused to answer or wasnt home on the three attempts made to speak with her
-She refused to submit a current statement of her savings account or any of her checking account statements
-She has since blocked our number and submitted her 60 day notice to vacate because she refused to re-certify.
We have accepted her notice to vacate and will work to make her move as simple as possible from this point forward.  Thank you.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/property-management/envolve-communities-0543-11834

Billing/Collection Issues,1592241036,Answered,02/25/2021,Initial Complaint,"Discrimination, Slum Lords, Non-compliance, Health Code Violations I have reached out to the company several times and have been told that someone would contact us but they never have. The current unit we reside in, and not just us but other tenants, falls way below the health guidelines for adequate and safe housing. Not to mention billing issues where the on site management is attempting to bill us for blind replacement that never took place and constantly sending letters stating we need to pay owed money or surrender the property. This issue has been ongoing for months now and the issues surrounding health code violations have existed since moving into the unite which passed several inspections. The property have plumbing and piping they refuse to replace that has been back up in the walls of each unit for years. Traces of asbestos in the water after testing to the point we have to filter every stream of water that comes from the pipes in the unit. Mold has developed in the ducting system due to moisture accumilation from poor duct work and pipping. There are constant health issues with us as well as the residents due to lead latex paint that has been thickly applied to the walls over time and disgusting carpet in the units. They fail to replace the filters in the units every month or 3 months well before the pandemic and management and maintenance gets upset if you ask. They have gone up on the rent but ensure to pocket the money by doing just the bare minimal on the outside. The grounds are unkept and there is always trash everywhere except one trash in the very front for visual appealing appearances. The water is full of chlorine to the point bathing with it dries the hair out to a point of irritation. Watering plants with the same water and they turn yellow overnight. The rental office at *************** Savannah, Georgia sent a letter in our door stating they were going to add $40 to our account for a blind replacement during the pandemic and take it upon themselves to replace it afterwards. There is no violation in our lease about blind replacement immediately as long as the issue is taken care of during inspection and upon move out. There is also nothing in the lease that says they can bill you for work they have never done and tell you that you need to pay it or relinquish the property. This place should be torn down completely and deemed unlivable. The wiring is poor and because of their lack of proper air ducting and wiring, the electric bill every month is $150 or more. I have never paid an electric bill over $80 in my life until moving to Georgia. They went up on the rent to close to $1,000 a month but the quality is not there. Many residents are sick of the issues and whoever owns the property is collecting money and vacationing with it. One maintenance worker. making repairs with disgusting shoes on with trash and bile tracking across carpet within the unit. That is bacteria and can cause sickness and other health issues. Pipes constantly leaking and A/C and heat never working but expecting us to pay a seperate gas bill.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/property-management/envolve-communities-0543-11834

If there are safety hazards or concerns, resident has not brought those to the attention of the management or maintenance staff but we would definitely need to know about those issues and get them addressed immediately. As to the utility bills, the management does not control the settings in the unit itself and if there are outside factors causing utilities to be high, we have no record of those issues either.

Advertising/Sales Issues,1592241029,Answered,12/23/2020,Initial Complaint,"The Company added water charges from prior months that have passed. Resulting in tenants in the negative without being notified. Missing Credit. On November 2020, tenants at *************************** noticed on the portal when trying to pay rent that there were charges added and backdated to the account from July 2020. I personally called the office numerous of times and never got a answer. I also called Corporate twice at this point & left messages but never received a call back. Rent is due by the 5th. I got a money order for my rent of $1052 and called the office and spoke to a new worker who was supposed to have replaced the other workers. I asked her about the extra charges & she stated that she needed to pull my file. So while waiting she stated that I was missing October's rent. I told her that I have always paid my rent & have had a credit on my account since I have been there. She stated that she don't see any credit on the account. So at this point my money has disappeared. I verified October's rent then she put me on hold & came back to say that it was for September's rent. I verified September's rent. Again she put me on hold then says it's looking like Julys rent is not paid. I then questioned which month is it because obviously she's just guessing at this point. I verified July and told her that I will pay my November rent but someone need to explain these charges and my missing money. After sitting on the phone for 45 minutes she stated it was water charges from previous months. I mentioned that I have paid my water every month out of my credit. I always get these outrageous water bills in the mail between $140-190 every month. I started out paying them until I called the office months back questioning why they were so high. Ms. ******** stated that was not the right amount and they adjust it at the beginning of the month. She also then mentioned I had credit to my account. I was told my rent was 1052 and that's what I was paying every month along with the water bill. I asked for a ledger. The ledger shows that my rent is only $1018 and water is adjusted to $34 every month which totals $1052. I called about it again back in April 2020. I stated to ******** that I'll just keep paying the $1052 & I'll call every month to get my credit and verify my water so she could take it out. So therefore every month I was overpaying. But when the new manager came in & added those charges manually somehow my money disappeared. it shows as if I had a balance rolling over unpaid every month. I continued calling corporate because I never got this resolved. December comes in and I'm still dealing with this issue. I called the office and corporate repetitively and left messages and sent emails. I never got a call back. It's not fair that they can just go back and charge because they claim tenants weren't properly charged. That's there mistake. We are in a pandemic and a lot of us are without jobs. It's like I have no legal rights. We should not have to just accept this behavior because of poor management. I'm getting harassed about making this payment of $294. I spoke to ******** on December 21 & 22 about this issue once she came back. She knew I had credit on my account when she left and I was not in the negative. But they also hired another manager with her and he called me on December 22 demanding payment and asking why I haven't paid. So I had to explain all over again & he was currently in the office with ******** and she knew the issue. He read the ledger & the way they went back at some point & keyed in the payments made it seem as if I was late every month. My credits were subtracted from my rent at the beginning of the month leaving a balance. He said I wasn't paying enough & that the $34 water charges were to less for a 3 bedroom. That's why they had to go back & adjust it. He stated my water for Jan 2021 will be $188 because it's calculated by the square foot in which I never heard of. I know they read meters. We as tenants Shouldn't be ignored or have to accept anything as if we are animals.

She will be calling her on Friday with an additional update. Ms ****** stated that her toilet is running currently. RM has called the manager to have the toilet fixed today. Again, she feels that she should not have to pay the water bill that is due. We informed her of what happened and why we had to back charge the H20. We also informed her that the water late fees would not be charged to her account. We do believe the office did not explain the ledger correctly and this resident thought she was paying the correct water amount. We will discuss further about crediting back late charges. Going forward this resident is aware that they will pay the amount of rent on the lease and the water bill sent to them by water systems. We have also instructed the office to only give residents the amount of water charges given to them by water systems. Consumer Response /* (3000, 16, 2021/02/12) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) At this time I'm not accepting anything until my account is straightened out. I will be satisfied when my account is at a zero balance. Also like stated, I had A credit on my account as well prior to them going back adding these charges In November (for June-November 2020) without notice or giving residence heads up. I'm not about to accept charges and be lost out on my money also. Even though I was paying the $1052 the lease stated every month They have been charging me $1018 every since I have moved in. My statements and everything says $1018. These are papers I get directly from them. I can't go into the system and change this stuff on my own. I pay what I'm told to pay by them. Now I'm wrong foe doing just that. It's not fair. I have no other documents of any of this stuff. That's the amount most residence pay with the same amount of bedrooms and space and amount of children I have. It also states on the lease my rent is $1052 and in fine print ""unless modified"". So Three months after renewing it automatically gets changed in the system back to $1052. So I think it should stay the $1018 until it's time for me to renew (which is not likely) bc that's what they been charging. As far as the toilet running this has been going on since I moved there and I have spoke to them about it. They sent maintenance over back then for this same issue but nothing happened. This is not a current issue. But as of now yes I'm waiting on the RM to call me back but I have not accepted anything until it's done right. If I have to take it to court then I'm prepared. I have all of my screenshots, documents, screen recordings and when everything was added before and after, pictures, and anything else you can name. It's sad that I have to do this. There was never a issue with my account until November 2020 when we all discovered that the managers were not there and they brought in a new lady for a few weeks.

Due to the liability of the fumes from the tub resurfacing , the resident would not be allowed to remain in the unit during the process. The vendor did come out and resurfacing was not needed, only a deep cleaning which was performed on 11/18/2020. In regards to the trash issue, the incident occurred several weeks ago, as a result of the compactor being broken by an unknown source which resulted in repairs being needed. It took 3-days for the vendor to receive the necessary parts, the repair was completed immediately thereafter. Pressure washing is needed throughout the property and will be addressed accordingly, however this issue is non-threatening and poses no danger to anyone so will be done as time permits during COVID restrictions.

Billing/Collection Issues,1592241022,Answered,07/22/2020,Initial Complaint,"Riverbend Place Apartments/Envolve not responding to maintenance request. Being ignored. Leasing Office need someone who can assist the community. Let me tell you a little about myself and the reason for this letter. I live at Riverbend Place Apartments, which is managed by your company Envolve Communities (Ledic). I have resided at this residence for over five years. I have never been late with my rent nor caused any problems. I take pride in my apartment. However, since Envolve Communities (Ledic) took over Riverbend Place Apartments this community has gone down. The leasing office has a high turnover, which cause issues with follow-up, consistency and completion of tasks within the community. Which leads into my next issue, lack of follow through with maintenance requests even in writing. We have a young woman in the office, who has major limitations on what she can do. Everything I have requested she has had to contact Sarah T***, the Area Manager. I have called Sarah T*** and left several messages and as of today, I still have not received a called back. It is disappointing and unprofessional to have a customer service individual working for a company consistently and repeatedly ignores the customer/tenant. Please see the attachment as proof of my last maintenance request that I am still trying to get completed. The maintenance worker is only on the property on Wednesdays and he never gets the request fixed. We could benefit from the addition of more skilled maintenance workers on the property to assist with the requests. I would like to make you aware of and request your assistance with getting your staff to fix the power issue we are having. I put in a request on June 2, 2020. Last week (July 15, 2020), I did a follow up since we only have someone in the office on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The young woman called me and told me that ***** would be here about my request. My power keeps cutting off. It initially began in the kitchen; now it has moved to the restroom.****** came out and said it was not an issue on their end but the power is being overloaded and the complete unit should have this issues. The representative also stated that we need to alert and continue to address this to your company before this starts a fire. The young woman from the office (CeeCee) was standing there and also heard him say that an electrical company needs to evaluate the wiring. As they left, she stated she had to, once again, call Sarah T*****someone working for you of 28 years) to see what she needed to do. Can Riverbend Apartment get some people in the leasing office that have some authority and autonomy to handle the community without calling Sarah T***? We should have had an electrical company out here the next day. It should not take months to get things fixed around here. It only takes a day for your company to endorse my rent check, so I am requesting that same turn around in contacting me and working on my issues as a long time tenant. Finally, I am still waiting on the completion (clean up and correct source issue) of a restroom (see picture) of the mold on the wall. This apartment is a handicap apartment; however, the shower does not have anything to block the water from hitting the wall. I was told that they would be putting a guard up to reroute the water away from the wall. I am still waiting on this. I have tried to navigate the company website, and it is not user friendly. I found one company phone number and I can not get any help. Does Sarah T*** has a superior that can successfully assist me? I have attempted to contact Sarah several times to no availability. Your mission is to continually set the standard for excellence in multi-family housing with a culture of innovation, collaboration, caring, and accountability I have not seen this in Envolve Communities (Ledic). Will you please have someone review and address these matters? I have attached all the paperwork to support my statements in this letter. I can be reached at the above information. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you,",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/property-management/envolve-communities-0543-11834
Billing/Collection Issues,1592241022,Answered,07/28/2020,Business response,"Business Response /* (1000, 5, 2020/07/28) */ Manager reached out to resident in regards to water issue. Backsplash for tub has been ordered but is on back order at this time. The power issue is due to so many residents being at and working from home and overloading the breakers. We had an electrician come out and check everything to ensure there is not a fire hazard and check the breakers. ***** has checked everything as well and there are no issues other than lots of extra residents at home during the day. Property has a new Regional manager and issues were dropped in transition which is not normal or acceptable. Regional manager is working with the manager at the property to get these issues resolved and provide better service to all residents moving forward. Consumer Response /* (3000, 7, 2020/08/06) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) Envolve Communities thank you for your vague reply. I was told back in June from the young woman (CeeCee) in the office that the backsplash was ordered. As for the power issue,***** was on the property and they were the company who said it was an issue. Riverbend also had another electric company to come out as well. However, my power outlet in the kitchen and restroom still goes out in the day and evening. Now I understand that people might be home more, but that is a poor excuse for you to give me and I should not be continually affected because of that. Please provide the new Regional Manager's name and when did this take place? As far as the Regional Manager, Sara T**** I left several messages and she's still employed with the company so if that was the case the professional thing to do was to forward my messages to the correct person. Also, I think the young lady in the office needs to be informed along with Sara T*** that Riverbend has a new Regional Manager. Because the young lady in the office is always saying she needs to contact Sara T*** before doing anything as of the last time we communicated. How about allowing the young lady to do her job without the third party? This is the only person I know that Envolve/Ledic has hired in the leasing office (we have seen plenty, very high turn over, our information has been with a lot of people) that has to contact the regional manager before doing anything or maybe have the regional manager on the property. Next, I think someone thought I would be pacified with a vague reply and that would suffice but it is very unacceptable along with these fallible remedies that are not truly solving any stated problems Envolve. I wonder does Mr. Scott P***** L******** know about these substandard practices and less than stellar tactics that are used to represent him? However, I advised you should have contacted the young lady in the office and Sara T*** before responding because if Sara T*** was not the Regional Manager why was she on the property, Friday, July 31 and I spoke with her about the issues with my apartment? She even came to my apartment. We discussed that she would have the electric company to come backout Wednesday, August 5, 2020, after we discussed the power issues and after I give her dates and times the power went out only in that area. As for the backsplash, Sara T*** stated it was ordered. As of August 5, 2020, working from home. The electrician did come out. His professional opinion is this apartment is being hit by power surges and he recommends to the leasing office that a power probe needs to be placed on my apartment. When will this happen? The Maintenance Technician was also here to add the shower splash ender. However, he stated to me that they will not work because of the way my shower is positioned. He told me he would have to let Sara T*** know about the issue and they would need to get a company out to see what the best option is. Minutes later he came back and said Sara T*** said put it up anyway. He only did what he was told, and he should not be held accountable but this is unacceptable. Do I need to send some more letters out to get this corrected? 1. Who is the new regional manager? 2. When will the backsplash or proper remedy be installed in my apartment to correctly address the issue? 3. When will the wall where the water was hitting be fixed? 4. When will the power probe be added?

We would like to address your concerns with this complaint for the property Village at Sun Valley Mesa, AZ. The Property Manager contact your husband and spoke to him regarding these concerns and he was satisfied with their conversation. Currently, at this time, flooring vendors are not installing in any occupied units. We replaced the carpet/flooring a couple of years back and the bedrooms were not a concern at the time and we are happy to revisit this request. The manager said she would be happy to inspect the unit once they have lifted the COVID-19 restriction for installing flooring. As for moving furniture for installation, we can discuss the options available. Our maintenance team is currently servicing the area and the pool daily to make sure that any trash, pet waste, and pools are maintained. We have spoken to the staff to ensure they are handling the area and not missing any trash/pet waste. As for the pool being locked, we currently are required to keep the pool closed due to COVID-19. We will open it once we have direction and restriction is lifted. Until then, we will continue to maintain it while it is locked. As for the dead plants and granite, we have found that there was a disease going around that affected many of the plants. We tried to save them and it was too late. They have been scheduled to be removed and we are reviewing options for replacement currently. We replaced granite a few years back for the entire property and will get a bid considering the plant removal to see what we need to do during this project. Please feel free to reach out to the Property Manager with any concerns or issues you may have with your apartment. She is more than happy to discuss and find solutions for any challenges or concerns that you may have. Consumer Response /* (3000, 9, 2020/07/31) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) It is completely untrue that the pool and grounds are being maintained on a daily basis. The pool is not being maintained and a cursory leaf blowing and grass mowing is done once a week. Trash accumulates over the week between blowing and may or may not be removed by landscapers. The dead plants have been an issue for over three months, despite numerous notifications and complaints to management. We have been told on at least three separate occasions over those months that new landscaping companies are being looked into for grounds maintenance and plant removal and no progress has been made at all. The dead plants are still rotting in front of our apartment. We received another substantial rent increase in June after the January increase and we are not receiving any basic value for our money. Our bedroom carpet is infested by small beetles and other insects although we self-clean it regularly. It requires frequent spraying around the edges with pesticides. All we are asking is that we be afforded aesthetically pleasing grounds and sanitary floors for our almost-$1000-per-month rent.

I called the towing company and was told that they are open on Monday at 9 a.m. Monday morning, I picked up my vehicle from the towing company. The towing company was not able to inform me why my car was towed, but they did show me that my license plate did not have a current sticker. My car registration is current and my sticker was on the license plate. Apparently, it had been stolen. I was unaware. I later put in a police report, today. I headed to the office to express my concerns, today, April 18, 2022. I spoke to the Assistant Community Manager, Ms. Tiffany McDaniels about my car being towed. The towing company reported that someone from Uptown Square office (manager or security) had called them to tow a vehicle in my area. I have lived here for 15 years! My car has been parked, in the same spot, for 6 years! I live directly next to the office. They know my car! Security knows my car! Ms. McDaniels proceeded to tell me that my car was safe until 5 p.m. After that time, it could be towed, again. I was upset hearing that I could be asked to pay another towing fee! I asked her to clarify this because it didn't make any sense to me. It was not even possible for me to rectify the situation, by the end of today. My vehicle registration is current and I have proof of that; however, I would have to file a police complaint and it's going to take some time for me to get my sticker that goes on the license plate. In short, I still do not know why my car was towed. I had to pay the towing company, DTS, $295. 85. I would like to be reimbursed. There is no justification for towing my vehicle.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/property-management/alco-management-inc-0543-24000191

I lived in an apartment complex called Riverset Apartment located in Memphis, TN, within a neighborhood called Harbor Town. Since I've lived here (March 11, 2020), I have had problems with dirt and air entering the windows in both my bedroom windows, air coming in through the patio door, and a multiplicity of waterbugs, mosquitos, and spiders. My dermatologist stated that a ruptured bump on my breast exhibited signs of a spider bite. The only time anyone sprayed for insects was only when I called. Each time I called about the windows, someone would come a week or more later and say it's fixed, though it never was. About three to four weeks ago, a window company was sent to my apartment to say there was nothing they could do, because the issue was the windows themselves, and the apartment complex was definitely not going to replace them. They told me the apartment complex was aware of this. The last maintenance man informed me that my patio door has been missing a piece since I've lived here. That's why I can see the outdoors through the gap that allows insects, rain, dirt, and cold air to come in. I live alone. My utility bills have been astronomical after it became cold outside due to air coming in through the windows and the patio door. I have been experiencing much more since I've lived here, but this is the worst of it. To pay $1,270 per month with such treatment is unacceptable. My lease ends March 12, 2021, of which time I will have moved out. I am asking for some sort of reimbursement of some of the rent that I've paid over the past 12 months.

In speaking with the owner of the company he stated that the windows did not need replaced and he could not find any issues. The window is set back with a flower bed and bushes in front of it so he could not see how it was possible for debris to enter when the landscapers were on property.

There are alot of insects nests that is still surrounding the apartment complex that needs to be clean. They should at least clean up the exterior part of the building. I seen countless water bugs enter my apartment from the outside. The exterior part of the building is nasty. There are still Wasp nest, water bugs, spider webs, and other insects nest that is still above my door and is around my door.  I feel like they still need to clean up the exterior part of the building because thats why its easy for bugs to enter the apartment.  Pictures are above and need to be resolved. Thanks!

There is ***** and yellow water which appears to be urine and f**** on my counter where I prepare meals.I can't keep appliances on that side because it's to dangerous. This is on going they send out folks who look at the water marks but never fix the pipes or go in and replace pipes that leak. It's unsanitary and terrible!This has gone on for years. I just got tired of calling or telling people because nobody did anything to help. I am tired of having to fall from the puddle of water in the kitchen that has accumulated while I was laying down. It's so horrible and unnecessary to have to plan around this leak. It's constant and annoying. I showed my neighbors both upstairs and they say they don't have a clue what they can do.

Problems with Product/Service,1562796378,Answered,02/17/2022,Initial Complaint,"My lease was set to be renewed on Feb. 1st 2022. I did my 60 day notice once corporate finally mailed me my renewal options and turned it in months ago. The closer February came, I was told I could NOT renew my lease without going thru a company called ***** to protect my refundable deposit. I never heard of ***** before so I contacted them and they informed me that this was required for NEW TENANTS only but they claimed corporate would not let me renew without it. So since I was renewing I'd be fine. Well, after completing the ***** deposit I never received my lease and the Ice storm was a blame as well. However, still no lease has been brought to my attention until today which is over two weeks of waiting and constantly calling and emailing them. I'm being told that my lease was delayed because the lady named ***** quit and never told the property manager to complete my lease. Today, I received my lease and it has the wrong dates on it, but the rent price is correct. However, the property manager is telling me that I have no choice to pay that balance, but I never agreed or signed to pay that amount of rent. Also, I'm being told to pay $875 this month and then back to $725 which makes no sense. I never was supposed to pay $800 so I was told from ***** to pay the $725 and I did but after February 7th it put me as a delinquent account. So now I am being told I have to pay the late fees and my rent for next month is not what is on my lease, but I was just told from the property manager that I have to pay the $775 on the portal. Why would I have to pay $775 and I agreed to $725? Now I'm being told that corporate can't assist me and that I have to pay a total of $875 for the month of March. Please make this make sense. I've contacted News Channel 3 as well because this is the third time that they have tried ti wrongfully charge me and I refuse to pay it this time.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/property-management/hm-heckle-company-inc-0543-6815

Per Shelby County Records the Shelby County Trustee's office accepted Mr. *******'s bid on the property at ********************** Memphis, TN XXXXX on September 3, 2020 providing Mr. ******* with ownership of the property. Looking at the recorded tax sale decree, those papers were officially recorded on October 8, 2020 meaning the property was officially Mr. *******'s property. Mr. ******* should have been responsible for the ongoing association fees of $150.00 starting October 2020, however our office was not made aware of who the purchaser was until later in October 2020, at which time we emailed Mr. ******* his online portal link. In all reality Mr. ******* should have been charged the monthly dues starting October 2020 but we did not start charging Mr. ******* until January 2021. We notified Mr. ******* that he was responsible for the special assessment that was remaining due for the unit and that he had to begin making the monthly payments of $108.00, however no payments were received on the special assessment until March 31st, which meant the special assessment was quite behind with no payments being received. While a lien was requested and added to his account we noticed that a true lien was not received by the courthouse, even with one requested. As you can see in the attached print out from Memphis Daily News there are no liens that have been filed against the property at 3556 Wild Briar Court since Mr. ******* has owned the property. Please note that we have already removed the fee from Mr. *******'s account as we told him we would when we spoke with him last.

I was taken to court a month later to be evicted for nonpayment after being stalked by my landlord/property manager because of a visitor ( my daughter home from college)! She moved me into a unit above her family. They watched my children come and go! She tried to bully me into moving and I wouldn't. I'd only been there a few weeks. I was still getting new furniture delivered. The landlord purposely told me she was not accepting my rent. She blocked me from paying online as well just so she could take me to court. She declined my rent and I filed a lawsuit the next day. She then filed days after me. Of course with COVID constantly pushing our dates back we finally went to court. The courts ruled I move and no money to be paid. She lied about her reason for taking me to court and I had proof to show that I attempted to pay! It was frivolous and should never had been filed to begin with.. I was given the opportunity to pay and stay or move in 10 days . I chose to move . NO money was awarded. In fact her and her attorney told the judge they didn't want money just the apartment. That's what happened. I moved in the allotted time (10 days) She had the opportunity to do a walk-thru and she didn't. The landlord has reported a made up balance that reflects way pass the date I moved. I have not been taken to court since and no judgements have been awarded. She has since been selling my information to collection agencies for an amount out of nowhere. This lady has also given me bad referrals to other complexes as I apply for them. Her problem was that I have a large black family. They can't keep any stable staff .

I have a four month old son and the condition that the apartment remains in after the flooding is both an unsafe and unsanitary environment for myself and my child, and as a result I had to seek temporary shelter in a hotel.

When I reached out to Management initially, I was told that the repair would be completed the very next day. That did not happen. Further correspondence with Management has not yielded any results. Upon reaching out to them a second, third, and fourth time, I was told that they do not know when the damages would be repaired. I asked if I could be transferred to another unit within the complex and I was met with resistance. I always pay my rent in a timely manner each and every month and I am beyond frustrated by the response and treatment of the Management Team at the Apartment Complex regarding this matter.

Delivery Issues,1592240457,Answered,08/28/2020,Initial Complaint,"Yes, I moved into the Trezevant apartment complexes in February of this year and had problems with the company's property manager for no actual reasoning. I was called names and disrespected beyond measure,just for having concerns with what was coming from my shower and tub, that broke my skin completely out and toilet not being able to flush.Two weeks of me renting the property I received a call from Tanisha W*******(leasing agent) stating that I would be receiving my deposit back and that I had to move due to their company not being able to fix my plumbing issues inside my apartment. Overwhelmed and not knowing the actions to take, I contacted my mother in law, who had experience in working as a leasing manager about the situation and she called the office informing them that they could not just put me out and that they would have to move me into a different unit. A few hours later I got a call from Ms. W*******, telling me that they would put me in a different unit after I pay my rent, which I did. It took them a week to move me out of the first unit, which still had plumbing issues that filled the apartment with a foul odor. My son and I couldn't bathe or use the restroom. The apartment unit I was relocated to was not acceptable in any fashion, there were huge dark spots in the carpet throughout the apartment where furniture was once sitting, feces on blinds, a permanent stench through the home and unsanitary for my child and me to reside in.

I was unable to log into the address you provided ( I do not have a fax, so I am replying to your email. ********** informed us that she was having a pluming issue on the building she was residing ******** The unit she moved in**** was completely renovated after been abandoned for more than 5 years by the previous owner of the property. With that said, we were not aware of any issues until tenant moved in to that particular building. Since we did not know the reasons for her issues and had a couple of pluming companies trying to find out the source of the problem we Immediately offer her the option to move out and return her security deposit or to move to another unit. She choose to move into another unit, which was shown to her prior to move in and she did accept the unit. A few days later she started complaining (even though she has seen the unit) about the carpet. We offer her again to move out and we would return her security deposit once the unit was vacant. She moved out, pick up her check (we have a receipt) and cashed the check. We never said mentioned eviction, because this was not the case for her situation. After a couple of weeks, she contacted the office again asking to move back to the complex. We denied knowing that she is a trouble maker. In late August she called the office again asking for references, I was the one answering the phone call, at this time, I informed her that we do not give references. It seems odd that she is filing a complaint after 4 month she moved out.

In March of this year, I began searching for an apartment to move into. Since I am a college student I decided to look at Stratum on Highland because I was told that they cater mostly to college students. When I visited Stratum, the lady showed me around and told me that I could move in the following semester (Fall Semester). I told her that I was looking at other apartments because I needed something on or before June. She than told me that their vacancies fill up fast so if I wanted to be notified of a spot I needed to provide my email; which I did. At the end of April, I received a call from one of the other apartment complexes and they told me that they would have three apartments available in May. Since that apartment complex had something sooner I decided to lease with them and I moved in on May 15th. In July, I received a phone call from a lady at Stratum and I told her that I had found and moved into a complex that had apartments available in May. She told me that since I would not be leasing from them that I would need to find a tenant to move into their apartment. I told her that that was not my responsibility and that I never signed a leasing agreement, promissory note or any other type of document with them. For the remainder of that month, I received several harassing calls from a lady at Stratum. Then in August, I received a ""Welcome Home"" email from them. The email contained a link and when I clicked on the link it took me to a portal that contained a leasing agreement that I had never seen before. The portal also contained an accounting statement that reflected an outstanding balance of $9,538.08. I am baffled by Stratum business practices. First, I never signed a leasing agreement with them because I was never provided one and second, I absolutely do not owe them any money for occupancy as I have never lived in their apartment. Stratum on Highland intimidating tactics are unfair and unethical. I am a full-time college student that works a full-time job and I do not need the extra stress that they are adding to my life.

We have been very patient. We have also tried to handle this properly by filing a police report for the damage she did to our daughters property. She damaged her property and entered our daughters room without permission while she was not home. While our daughter was at work the roommate took all of the groceries and frozen items out of the refrigerator and freezer and placed them on the counter and turned up the heat and left them out to ruin. Today our daughter was unable to get the air conditioning turned on. The apartment was extremely hot. She had a fever of 102 and had the flu, possibly RSV, which is very serious due to her having severe asthma. She could not stay home and checked into a hotel while severely ill.

I am rejecting this response because:
I have sent this to Jee Par twice with no response 
****** has now moved into her new room. We did this under protest because it was the only way to keep her safe. We have filed all the necessary reports concerning the illegal drug use in ******'s previous room. We have sent pictures of unlawful drugs, and your employees have confirmed the drug use. We want to be clear on this just in case something bad happens concerning this roommate and the illegal drugs that are being used in the apartment.
We have incurred several expenses. ****** has missed a week at work. We had to bring her back to ******* for a few days to keep her safe from the drug use and the bullying that was taking place. We also had to rent hotel rooms to keep her out of harm's way. Dealing with **** has been extremely difficult. We are asking for the hotel expenses to be reimbursed ($743.16). We are also asking for the gas it cost us to bring her home ($100) and the $300 she lost by missing work and $200 for eating expenses while she was unable to access her apartment safely. 
We want to reiterate that we have notified you of the illegal drug use and that your employees have confirmed it. 
At one point, we were told that ****** would be able to return to her room and that her roommate would be moved out by noon. Instead, ****** was forced to stay in a vacant room without her belongings. You get the picture: no shower curtain, no towels, no food, nothing. I feel like we have been the victims of bullying and abuse by the roommate as well as the gross negligence of **** in enforcing the rules concerning illegal drug use and bullying.
We are asking for:
Hotels $743.16
Gas $100
Missed Work $300
Expenses $200
Total $1343.16

Problems with Product/Service,1438873224,BBB unable to locate business,09/16/2022,Initial Complaint,My daughter leased an apartment from this company and moved out in July of 2022. We were charged over $600 of damage charges when she moved out. We sent pictures and videos showing the satisfactory condition that she and her roommates left the apartment. We were also charged for keys that hadnt been turned in when she did turn them in. When we called to inquire about the charges we were told by an employee that they had assigned blanket charges to all tenants because they werent the company that owned the apartments when they moved in and therefore didnt know what shape they were in when the moved in. When we sent videos and pictures as proof they will not respond. We finally got someone else on the phone and they said over a month after the charges had been assigned to everyone that they had not even checked the apartments since tenants moved out. They have threatened to send the charges to collections. We also paid $50 a month for two years for gated parking when the gate was NEVER closed. It was part of the lease agreement that it would be closed at all time. They also refuse to return our $300 deposit even though proof has been provided.

Billing/Collection Issues,1424965135,Answered,01/06/2022,Business response,"Business Response /* (1000, 7, 2021/10/29) */ All funds due Mr. ******* including back rent, any rent due, owner impound and security deposits have been refunded to him per his Management Agreement. We were a few days late in refunding the final portion of funds owed him due to people being off in our office due to Covid 19. Consumer Response /* (3000, 9, 2021/11/09) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) ******** ****** (President of JD Marks Realtors) provided a much longer response (attachment 1,1 page) to the complaint I filed with the Tennessee Real Estate Commission. His response to the Commission does not cite COVID-19 as a reason for not paying the funds owed to me within the timeframe outlined in the contract. After filing complaints with the Better Business Bureau and the Commission, I received a check from Mr. ****** on October 18, 2021 (for $461.38) and a second check on October 22, 2021 (for $200.00) - 86 days after the termination of the contract and 26 days beyond the 60 days called for in the contract. That is more than ""a few days,"" as characterized by the response provided to the Better Business Bureau. Although Mr. ****** provided me with only 7 pages of accounting documents with the check received on October 18, 2021, he provided the Commission with 23 pages of documentation (attachment 2, 23 pages). I believe that the documents provided to the Commission by Mr. ****** demonstrate that he is still in violation of remitting all funds owed to me. For example: (1) Although the Mutual Release Agreement was not emailed to me by Mr. ****** until July 28, 2021, I notified ***** Quinn (the property manager with whom I worked) on July 20, 2021 of my desire to cancel my contract (attachment 3, 5 pages). On the check register (from 7/01/21 thru 7/31/21), there is a charge for $440.00 on July 22, 2021 two days after I notified them of my intention to cancel my contract. The work order provided by Mr. Gordon indicates that this charge was to patch holes in the walls. In fact, the holes were still there when my new property manager assumed responsibility for the building on August 1, 2021. She arranged for all repairs to the unit, including the holes left by Mr. ******'s non-paying evicted tenant (attachment 4, 1 page). (2) On the Operating Statement dated July 29, 2021, there is a charge of $1,395.00 for ""carpenter repairs."" I cannot find an invoice for any carpenter repairs for that amount among Mr. ******'s documents. Also, the contract clearly states that any repair in excess of $1,000.00 must be approved by me (attachment 5, 1 page). Regardless of the amount, ***** Quinn always notified me of any repairs being done to the building, and this carpenter repair was never brought to my attention or approved by me. (3) On the Operating Statement dated September 29, 2021, there is an $80 charge for ""grounds maintenance."" The accompanying invoice from Porter Lawn Maintenance indicates services rendered on 8/3/2021 and 8/17/2021. My contract with Mr. Gordon's property management company was terminated on July 28, 2021. Mr. ****** has no legal authority to withhold funds for services allegedly performed after the termination of our contract. Given that I have provided the Better Business Bureau with a copy of Mr. ******'s response to the Commission, I believe it is necessary to point out false statements made by Mr. ****** in his response. (1) Mr. ****** states, ""Prior to the current complaint, there was never any claim by Complainant that he had not received all sums to which he was entitled."" In fact, I sent an email on October 6, 2021 reminding Mr. ****** that I had not received the funds owed to me, to which Mr. ******'s responded 4 minutes later that he would forward the funds to me (attachment 3, previously referenced). My complaint with the Commission was filed on October 13, XXXX X days after Mr. ****** acknowledged that he still owed me money. (2) Mr. ****** states, "". . . although this involved substantial expense for the eviction process itself and for repairs to the unit."" As noted earlier, I cancelled my contract immediately after the eviction of the non-paying tenant Mr. ****** placed in the unit. When my new property manager took possession of the unit on August 1, 2021, no repairs had been done. She has since arranged for the completion of all repairs including patching holes in the walls (attachment 4, previously referenced) and placed a responsible and reliable tenant in the unit. The fourth unit is currently being repaired and a responsible and reliable tenant has already been selected. It is unfortunate that Mr. ****** was not honest with me by admitting that successfully managing my building was beyond the ability of his property management company; it would have saved me a lot of time and money. But Mr. ****** and I can agree on the ""substantial expense for the eviction process."" It looks like letting Mr. ****** handle the eviction cost me approximately $2,500.00. (3) Mr. ****** states, ""J. D. Marks has forwarded statements for June, July, August, September, and October of 2021 to Complainant."" With the first check received on October 18, 2021, I also received 7 pieces of paper (attachment 6, 7 pages). No statement or documentation regarding income/expenses for July 2021 was included. It was not until October 29, 2021, when I received the documents Mr. ****** submitted to the Commission, that I saw any accounting of the income/expenses for July 2021. I am not sure why Mr. ****** would send the Commission 23 pages of documents while sending me only 7 pages.

We opened the closet door there was a red stain on the carpet and on the shelf was condoms. In the bathroom the toilet had dried up urine stains on the seat, the sink was dirty.

Problems with Product/Service,1557487628,Answered,07/14/2022,Business response,"The resident contacted our office via email on July 5, 2022 and she was in communication with the Assistant Property Manager. The Assistance Property Manager explained to the resident that Mill Creek had several HVAC calls that came in before hers and that we would get to her as soon as we could. When the Mill Creek team arrived at the resident apartment to ***** and make repairs to her a/c unit; they saw that the issue was created by the resident because she had changed out her thermostat to an digital thermostat that was not compatible to HVAC unit. The issue was not that the air condition was not working the problem was that the resident created the issue by making unauthorized alteration to the apartment and this is what caused the a/c from not turning on.  The Property Manager sent the resident email and advise of her the issue and she also sent the maintenance team back to change the thermostat back to the original one and the air condition work as it should and her unit is cooling.  We have attached copies of the email of our correspondence with the resident and in the emails you can see that the resident was happy that her issue has been resolved by simply removing the unauthorized thermostat back to the original one .

Complaint: 17523953

I am rejecting this response because: the repair main also repaired a part on the outside of my unit that was not working and this fixed the issue.  I have the video showing what he repaired outside. Per the repairmen, the thermostat was not the issue although it was replaced. The issue was the part outside. This does not excuse why other residents and even elderly residents are going with a/c in this heat or the abundance of trash on the property that is also a health concern. 

Sincerely,

As of now it's been a full week since my air has been out and no one seems to show any concern of health conditions or the people that stay in my apartment. I attempt to contact them and all I get is no answer or them telling me that they have too many maintenance orders and can't get to me right now. No one cares about anyone burning up in his heat and it's 95Â° outside. My thermostat also happens to say 100Â° and this is just too intense to be living in these conditions. I'm reaching out so someone can please help me thank you.,https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/apartments/new-horizons-apartments-0543-44032219

We recently had an increase in rental prices the end of 2020; 2 bedroom 1 bath now rents for $625 and 2 bedroom 1, 1/2 bath rents for $650. She rents a 2 bedroom 1 bath and signed a new lease Feb 5th that was effective March 1st, at the $625 rental rate in which every new lease will have the increase. At the time of the renewal Michelle, the assistance manager, mistakenly put $650 on her lease for the rental amount. At the beginning of this month when Ms. R***** paid a portion of her rent she noticed the amount on the resident portal and contacted the office and then came to the office. I pulled her file and saw the error; I corrected it and corrected the charges in our system. I also waived the month to month fee for Ms. R***** the month of February because she stated she did not receive prior notice of an increase. The notice should have gone out in Dec; Michelle nor I were working here in Dec, so I am not sure what happened about the notice. We can not force any resident to renew. At the end of the lease term, they renew or give notice and vacate; she renewed. Ms. R***** did not ask me for corporate number; I would give it to any resident who asks.

I apologized to Ms. R***** for the inconvenience that may have occurred, corrected the rental amount error my assistant made on the lease, and corrected her ledger. If a notice was not sent, it should have been sent. It appears Ms. R***** signed the lease without reading it and after realizing the increase, she filed a complaint; If she would like to terminate the lease, she can. Please give a 30 day notice April 1st, 2021, pay the rent owed, and vacate at the end of the 30 days. Business Response /* (4000, 13, 2021/04/06) */ The corporate number is ************.

My move in date was October 8th due to the apartment needing to be renovated. I was then told I need to give a $600.00 holding fee to secure the apartment along with first and last months rent.

October 8th came and I get the apartment key, the whole place is filled with roaches and it is not renovated. The place was absolutely filthy along with children's toys being left on top of cabinets from previous tenants. It had no renovations done and roaches on everything. Roaches on the walls, in the closets, on the stove and even in the microwave. My friend & I decided to bomb the apartment to see if this is something that can be handled, then when came back the next day. Still had roaches. Advised ******** of the infestation of which she told me and I quote ""well why did you spray? You shouldn't have sprayed now they're going to keep coming"" Instead of the Manager taking accountability for forcing me to pay a $500 deposit/holding fee along with first/last months rent for a bug filled, unlivable living space she argued with me. She is by far the most unprofessional person I've had the displeasure of coming in contact with. She contacted a Terminex company to come spray that Friday, went in that Sunday and the place had dead and live roaches still every where. She dragged her feet on trying to remedy the issue, offered no condolences or empathy and she then tried to tell me that ""I have to give it time"" when I'm suppose to live here. This went on for an entire week. It wasn't until after I threatened to call corporate that she told me that she will be giving me a new apartment on Monday and then give me the ENTIRE month of November off for inconvenience. I called back 3 days later and I was told that I cannot get November free rent and that my apartment is not done with the rudest attitude from ********. I no longer want anything to do with this complex. I want to be released from my lease and I want a full refund for EVERYTHING! This is disgusting, unprofessional, unsanitary and not to mention illegal. You cannot rent a uninhabitable, infested apartment to someone. Luckily for me I didn't even get a chance to actually move in any furniture or else they'd have roach droppings all over it! We are in the middle of a pandemic and it's shameful how people are trying to scam people out of thousands to live with bugs. I also have a child who is suppose to stay with me occasionally. This company expects me to subject my child to disgusting roaches? I went back today 10/26/20 and I was informed that my lease had been terminated and I will not be getting ANY of my money back. I will be filing a claim with small claims and contacting the health department if this outcome does not change. As someone who is National Guard I don't expect special treatment but I expect better than this.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/apartments/cedarwood-apartments-0543-44075072
Delivery Issues,1511504689,Answered,02/18/2021,Business response,"Business Response /* (1000, 5, 2020/11/09) */ I hope that all is well. My name is Lashonda Griffin, the new property manager at Cedarwood apartments/Sunridge townhomes. I appreciate the opportunity you've provided to elaborate on the false accusations that Marcus Taylor has presented to your office. Marcus Taylor has fabricated his story from the very beginning. Marcus was referred to Cedarwood through one of our sister properties by the name of Greenview Estates. He applied to Cedarwood on 9/10/2020 and was approved with conditions which meant he was required to pay a higher deposit which included first and last month's rent. Once Marcus Taylor viewed the apartment, he approved of it, but he was advised that it wouldn't be this unit unless he was ready to pay the nonrefundable holding fee which would hold the apartment until the lease was signed. I wanted to be clear that he knew that he needed to act immediately for this unit as another future tenant was also viewing this unit therefore, it is first come first served basis. Marcus did not pay his nonrefundable holding fee until 9/16/20. Regrettably, the unit that he viewed initially was no longer available since he waited almost a week to pay the fee. I had another unit available which I advised wouldn't be ready for another couple of weeks. Marcus agreed to wait for that unit and wanted to know if it would look like the first unit he saw. I explained that it wouldn't look the same, but all the upstairs units have high vaulted ceilings. I told Marcus that I would make sure that the unit would have all new appliances and new carpet however, I never mentioned that the unit has been newly renovated. Marcus move in date was scheduled for 10/8/20. He called that evening and stated that he would not be able to move in on that day due to him leaving town. He finally reached back out on 10/14/20 stating he was ready to come pick up his keys. I had maintenance walk Marcus to the unit which he accepted to move into. On 10/15/20, Marcus came to the office and said that the apartment was infested with roaches and that he bummed the unit. I asked Marcus why he didn't report this issue before bumming the unit because whatever he used could have made it worse. After hearing the report, I, Lashonda Griffin, immediately contacted Nu Era Pest Control, whom we have a contract with for the property. Nu Era scheduled an appointment to have the unit treated on 10/16/20. Marcus Taylor was present in my office during the phone call and witnessed me acting on this issue expeditiously. Marcus agreed to allow me time to resolve the issue. Pest control came during the scheduled time however, they couldn't do the treatment since they couldn't get into Marcus's unit. I was not aware that the unit wasn't treated until Marcus came to the office again reporting that there were still dead and live bugs in the unit, and he showed me a picture in his phone. I contacted pest control once again while Marcus was present, and they explained that the unit was never sprayed due to them not being able to get in the unit, so they rescheduled it for 10/17/20. They came out and treated the unit and I will upload the proper documents to attest that. Marcus decided over the weekend that he would do his own bumming which defeats the purpose of pest control. Maintenance went to the unit on Monday, 10/19/20, and saw that Marcus had cans of hot shot foggers everywhere. It was so loud that they could not stay in unit. Marcus came into the office the same day returning his keys stating that he cannot do it and that he didn't want to live with the roaches. I assured him that I completely understand and was still working to make this situation better. He agreed to be patient but, Marcus would not allow me to take the necessary steps to make the issue better. I explained to him that I can't make things right overnight but to give me the opportunity to fix it. We had a few disagreements along the way because Marcus felt I was being insensitive to his situation. Meanwhile, he asked if I had anything else available now. I advised that there weren't any units available to move in right away, but I had a unit that we were working on. In reference to Marcus's statement, he referred to me as snappy, uninterested, and rude. If this was true, I wouldn't have been taking the initiative to make the situation better. Marcus reached out to someone at the corporate office about his concern and they agreed to let him out of the lease or transfer him to another unit. I contacted Marcus by phone and gave him the options with a sincere apology. He told me he appreciates me for that and ask if the unit was not ready by a certain time could I give him half off rent or rent free for the month of Nov. I told Marcus I would see what I could do not making any promises but still choosing to wait on the apartment, to my knowledge I felt things where heading in the right direction. On October 22 ,2020 Marcus called the office asking about the key to the unit where he no longer reside, and I asked why? he stated he left the lights on I told Marcus I would send maintenance up to turn off all lights. Marcus got annoyed about my response and ask me what's the problem and started going back and forth with me and finally ending the conversation, on the very next day Oct 23, 2020 Marcus arrived at my office and I ask for the key once again I stated no! Marcus began to say I act like I got a problem with him he was told his lights would be turned off but, wasn't. and did not won't a high light bill the key was giving to pest control who was park right outside in front of the office heading to that unit because the unit was still being treated before renting to the next potential prospect. Marcus started going back and forth again with demands either give him the key or the address to the new unit I stated no to both I cannot give you the key as you can see pest control is out there and about to head to the unit. The new unit is not finish yet, so he started cursing by saying just turn my m*****f****** lights off. I advise Marcus to have MLGW to lights off if that was a concern. I picked up the phone and called maintenance and ask that he make sure that the lights will be turned off after pest control leaves. Marcus started up again and Tedario Jasper who is maintenance walked into the office to witness Marcus behavior spiraling out of control while making the statement saying nall f*** it just give me my money back. Tedario Jasper would not leave the office and observed me asking Marcus several times to leave which he refuse to do so. Finally, Marcus left, and I contact someone from corporate to inform them of the situation. I told them at this point I could not deal with him anymore Tyler Butts whom I had informed stated we would go ahead and let him out the lease, but he would forfeit his deposit. I later reached out to him by text to contact corporate from here on out so there was no need for him to come back. He text back we will be hearing from his attorney. On Monday October 26, 2020 Marcus showed up again very much out of control I did not let him in only speaking through the door. I told him to contact corporate. I have uploaded the incident/police report due to verbal threats which he fails to mention any of this to you, so I have attached several items please see and contact me if you have any further questions, I can send those Nu era invoices separately to show how efficient I handle the situation. The activity on Nu era pest control page shows the maximum times they came out including their normal twice a month routine. I am a firm believer in trying to do right by my residents, future resident, and prospects I can relate to certain circumstances so that's why I thrive to enhance the situation. Consumer Response /* (3000, 7, 2020/11/10) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) Thank you for your response. I was referred by a sister company due to an issue with the income cap. I also didn't pay the deposit until the 16th because LaShonda had to set up my online portal which she took her sweet time doing. I do admit that I made a mistake by stating I received the key on Oct. 8th. I did not view the apartment until Oct. 15th due to having drills that weekend of which I informed LaShonda of. I came to the apartment with a friend who will give a verified statement of the filth and roach infestation that the apartment had. I also have video, photos and recorded conversation of Lashonda's disgusting attitude. "" I told Marcus that I would make sure that the unit would have all new appliances and new carpet however, I never mentioned that the unit has been newly renovated."" This is false. I was informed that the apartment would be newly renovated since it had not been lived in FOR SOME TIME. And even if it was not renovated, that was fine but the roaches were not. To make matters worse, she never showed me the infested unit herself. The maintenance man did. She advised me to come at 5pm the day of knowing she was leaving for the day. We walked into the apartment and was met with filth and roaches as I've said. She can say she tried to get the roaches taken care of which she may have, but at the end of the day whether or not the place was sprayed the infestation still persisted. ""We had a few disagreements along the way because Marcus felt I was being insensitive to his situation. Meanwhile, he asked if I had anything else available now. I advised that there weren't any units available to move in right away, but I had a unit that we were working on"" I felt that way because LaShonda did not care about my situation or else it would not have escalated this far. As a property manager it is your duty to ensure that the place is livable before renting it out. Instead I'm met with malice when I have a huge issue about being forced to live with bugs. She did state that there are no units available, but if that is the case why did she tell me she will get me a new unit after I threatened to call Corporate? Also, she called my girlfriend Nydia and also stated to her that I will be getting a new unit. I also found that they were advertising units on CraigsList although their were none available? ""On October 22 ,2020 Marcus called the office asking about the key to the unit where he no longer reside, and I asked why? he stated he left the lights on I told Marcus I would send maintenance up to turn off all lights. Marcus got annoyed about my response and ask me what's the problem and started going back and forth with me and finally ending the conversation, on the very next day"" I have a $56.00 light bill from MPL DUE TO LASHONDA'S NEGLIGENCE TO ALLOW ME TO TURN OFF THE A.C. that is why I had an attitude. I INFORMED HER that the lights were still on when I wasn't even the one who turned them on, the maintenance people were. I requested them to be turned off and she did NOT do so! I will also upload that file as well. I also got an attitude with you because when I said ""Hello"" to the maintenance man, LaShonda stated ""Don't talk to my maintenance man"". That is why things escalated. I have multiple people who will vouch for LaShonda's disgusting attitude. "" Marcus started going back and forth again with demands either give him the key or the address to the new unit I stated no to both I cannot give you the key as you can see pest control is out there and about to head to the unit. The new unit is not finish yet, so he started cursing by saying just turn my m*****f****** lights off. I advise Marcus to have MLGW to lights off if that was a concern."" I requested the address to the new unit so I can simply transfer my lights over to that unit so I don't have to pay for electricity in a unit I am not in. She gave me issue as she admitted. If you do not have a new unit, then simply give me back my money and let me go on about my business. ""Finally, Marcus left, and I contact someone from corporate to inform them of the situation. I told them at this point I could not deal with him anymore Tyler Butts whom I had informed stated we would go ahead and let him out the lease, but he would forfeit his deposit."" This information was NEVER relayed to me. No one told me that I would forfeit any deposit. Also, the company took my first/last months rent AND my deposit. I never signed any agreements, never spoke to anyone from corporate until the 26th. ""On Monday October 26, 2020 Marcus showed up again very much out of control I did not let him in only speaking through the door. I told him to contact corporate. I have uploaded the incident/police report due to verbal threats which he fails to mention any of this to you"" I came on the 26th asking for my new unit or my money back. I was not let into the building for whatever reason. I never even got a chance to speak to anyone. I did lose my temper but I didn't physically or verbally threaten anyone or I would have had an interaction with the police which I did not. I also have contacted the local Memphis P.D. and they stated they do not have any open warrants in my name and I have also never been contacted by them. So I would love to see this so called police report as well. The company rented me an infested apartment, claimed to spray but the roach infestation still persisted. Even if I agreed to forfeit my deposit(which I did not) I am still owed my first months rent because the apartment was unlivable along with my last since I am no longer at the complex. Bottom line is as a PROPERTY MANAGER it is YOUR duty to ensure I have a livable unit which you did NOT do! I should not have to wait until a place is sprayed for me to live in it especially when I've paid for it already.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/apartments/cedarwood-apartments-0543-44075072

Problems with Product/Service,1439700181,Answered,01/29/2022,Initial Complaint,"My boyfriend and I wanted to move in to the apartment complex. He had lived there in the past. He said he would fill out the application for the apartments and paid his application fee of $75. We were told that in order for me to live there as well I would need to apply and pay $75 as well. All of this was completed by 1/10/2022. We were looking to move in on 2/1/2022. We were told it would take 5 days to get an answer. We never received a call. After being assured there weren't any issues after I called a few times. Every time I called the lady Ms. *** was always confused. I would give my name and she would have our applications confused with others. Time is moving and still no calls about our application. I finally called again on 1/27/2022 and asked if there was a problem. Ms. *** said my application was fine but had run into a snag with my boyfriend and would call tomorrow. My boyfriend called early 1/28/2022, he was informed but I was denied. I called to find out why and was told they couldn't tell me why only that I didn't meet their criteria. Keep in mind I'm a law abiding citizen, no record, 15 yrs on my job, 18 yrs in my current home, credit score 800 and sufficient income. I as finally connected to a manager that said I didn't qualify because I have a home. I assured the lady that I have sufficient income as well as a renter for my home with a lease to prove it. Then she went on to say there was an issue with my check stubs. My jobs utilizes ADP for our stubs, a very reputable and reliable company. She then went on to say she needed to verify my employment with my job. I'm confused because this should have already been done. But all of that aside, we were told from the beginning I couldn't live in the apartment if I wasn't on the lease but my boyfriend was approved and now it's okay for me to live there.

I am rejecting this response because: *********; overtalked me and she hung up on me before I finish talking. I wasn't trying to discuss anyone else account. I clearly was trying to explain what I did. Which was on March 3, 2023. I made payment for myself and two other people, and  requested receipts to be sent to the two other people so they can keep in their files. If you have a camera in office, you can run the cameras back to the morning of March 3, 2023 and see. We started bringing the payment into office and requesting receipt since incident from last year of our payments being stolen from your box outside of your office. 
I also came by the office at the end of February to get a receipt for my self for Feb. 2023 rent. I handed **** my driver's license with my current address of property I'm renting. **** then asked me what's my address, and I say the address that's listed on the license. She then copy my license and hands me a form fill out. On the form is a space asking for my SSN. Why do you need a SSN to provide me a receipt. My name and address, picture is on the license, lease and checks that pays the rent. I shouldn't have to provide a SSN just to get a printed receipt. They dont ask me for a SSN when i pay the rent. What is the purpose of needing to provide a SSN to get a receipt?

Who can afford to pay an extra ***** dollars for rent somewhere that they are not living there anymore. It is really unfair that this muliti-million company can do an average everyday working paycheck to paycheck person like this. This will also mess up my credit that it took me years to repair.

Problems with Product/Service,1579662742,Answered,10/13/2022,Business response,The notice to vacate requirements are clearly stated in your lease. The notice to vacate form that is completed also repeats those requirements so there are two different places in which the written requirements are noted. Legally the landloard has certain notice requirements that they must adhere to and tenants similarly have notice requirements that they must adhere to.

Complaint: 18177958

I am rejecting this response because:
I originally contacted the office(Sunshine Corporation) in advance about these documents associated with my complaint to avoid late fees as well as to insure we both meet the deadlines for ******** organization to send funds within expectations of Sunshine Corporation standards. Since ""Sunshine Corporation"" does not do payment plans, and have waited to send these documents, I will have to wait and see if they will still agree to the disbursement of MIFAs check; as well to see if there will be any court proceedings after the 15th. I want be able to get a follow up of the payment until the case manager assigned to me has returned next Monday.

We got stuck here for 3yrs due to moving in right before the pandemic. We would have left if we could afford it. They started sending me late fees but I was never late on rent. First time I got a notice I told them it is a mistake. They agreed and took the fee off. But then we got another. I addressed them again but they claimed I was lying and never called to address this. I sent them my phone records/proof that I paid rent on time. They ignored that email. They are literally robbing me as if living in a cockroach infestation without proper AC isn't miserable enough. IT GETS WORSE. Talking to my neighbors, I found everyone's having the exact same issues. I consulted with both a lawyer and *********************'s Rights and they suggested I ask to be either temporarily moved or for decreased rent due to issues. They said no to both. The would not let us break the lease in any affordable way. They only gave 60d notice option. We can't afford 2 rents but the choice was either have no AC and continue living in cockroaches or to leave and just hope and pray an affordable lawyer can help me.

The next day on July 1st , I contact her about the leak that morning when the office opened and she stated she would put a work order in. Then later on I went to the office to see why no one took care of it and she told me she was sending someone over to look at it. After that I was a little curious to see if my neighbor had the same issue and they knew nothing about it. Later on that same day, she told me she would contact a plumber about it because the maintenance man couldn't fix that type of issue. Then hours later, she knocked on my door stating that the first plumber canceled on her and that she have another coming at 7pm and there is nothing she could do till Tuesday, July 5th. The plumber look inside the apartment to see the issue and then proceeded to look at the apartment upstairs to see where the water was coming from. Then he came back down and told me that he fixed the problem and it should stop leaking. When I realized how my apartment was smelling and looking so bad, I knew it wasn't safe for my 2-year old and me to stay there. So I went out to get a hotel on July 3rd for the safety of us and then I filed an claim because I do have renters insurance that comes included in my rent payment in order for me to get reimbursement for having to spend my last trying to get a hotel after I paid my July rent. Then I got off of work to get an update and also a work order to send to the renters insurance for proof/details of my situation. As the maintenance was about to hand me the form I was requesting, the lady stopped him and told him to give it to her. She stated that she had to be the one that has to send the form out and the the insurance company clearly said I have to send the form off.

When I moved in, bleach stains were in dining room & adjacent to back living room. I noted this on move-in sheet. I express to property manager as well because she lied to me and my brother (who was present) that carpet was new. We both stated how when there are bleach stains, 1st red flag. I spoke with property manager and she didn't tell me the carpet fees exceeded deposit. In addition, during my stay at apartments I experienced many issues. Plumbing with the toilet. This caused a flooding and it took manager days before having someone to come. She didn't even replaced the carpet (which is why I used bleach to clean the walls odor was horrendous and bleach spilled on carpet). From cannabis smells to noisy neighbors to trash this apartment needs to be investigated. They only do 'patch work'. I submitted a ticket about kitchen floor. Underneath flooring there is internal damage only someone came to replace the tiles with crack but there is still a dent underneath the floor. Under sink bathroom took days to repair and odor was horrible couldn't live in the apartment until it was repaired. Property manager and maintenance once again did 'patch work'. Some tickets were ignored, others labelled as completed. Property manager doesn't even communicate with tenants about broken blinds, broken cars, and even put outside for months a large dumpster in the parking lot area (located on **** Dr).Attached are some pictures (I have others) that shows how management does not address issues but charge certain tenants for un-wrongful/ not applicable damage.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/property-management/makowsky-ringel-greenberg-llc-0543-3304

******** didn't communicate this with me about the the total balance. I had to email and call to get an understanding from her.

I would add that based on prior rentals, I have never heard of a requirement of (60) days as I am accustomed to (30) days' notice. But, I accepted the protocol as it is stated in the leasing agreement, thus the reason for this complaint. When I planned on moving out, I alerted the front office of my intent on or around July 23rd. I was informed that because I am within the (60) days that I must pay the remaining days to cover the difference in days. This amounted to $703.00. I felt that this was taking advantage of the situation because I officially moved out in August. I had already resigned to paying for a month that should have covered me through the leasing terms (13 months), September 8, 2020.

There was a Residential Ledger sent that itemized damages that totaled $1493.13 minus the security deposit of $500.00. There were COURT and FED charges included on the 'Final Invoice'.

Per the lease agreement the court cost and filing fee are owed by the resident in the event the landlord must file due to non-payment of rent. We are happy to provide a copy of the residents lease agreement highlighting these areas. The outstanding balance owed on this previous resident account is $993.13 Consumer Response /* (3000, 7, 2020/10/23) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) Received acknowledgement email in July about my intent to move out. It had a ledger of the expenses due prior to moving out. But, in the email it states that they were not expecting keys until the 23rd since the lease did not end until then. That is when payment should have been expected. According to the lease agreement, which I have attached, it says that if payment is received after the 5th, there will be a late fee imposed, which according to the 'Final Invoice' the late fee was imposed. No mention of Fed and Court Fees. September 18th, I received acknowledgement of the keys and inspection would be done on Sept. 19th or 22nd. Sept. 23rd email was sent with photos, and we contested a few of them, but in the email as you can see it states the property manager has not finalized our paperwork. Kelly stated the process would take 2-3 weeks, which already was projected the 'Final Bill' would come in October. Oct. 2nd, I received an email with all of these charges, which included the late fee (consequence of not paying by the 5th), along with Court and Fed Fees. This was the first time I have ever even heard of those types of charges. Lease Agreement is attached, by which my signature is on there, but, no mention of if tenants do not pay by the time the apartment is vacated, there would be a late fee in addition to court and fed fees mentioned. An attorney would contest this as it seems that this apartment complex is imposing unfair charges to their tenants and being unreasonable as we have, in good faith contacted the apartment of our intent to fulfill the leasing agreement. We have been responsible and great tenants. No where have we looked to be shady, but, looked to have a resolution as again, they imposed these court costs and fed costs and what is that? We are not criminals. They do not have to go through lengths to find us. I have sent many emails to them, they know how to reach me. There was no need in evening mentioning that in the event if the payment was not received that they had to file for non-payment. Are they serious? I have been in contact with them m*** than I have been in contact with my own mother. I even went back and forth with Kelly and Michele G*** to resolve this matter, but, Michele cut off communication and this is why I had to file this complaint. There should not be a court and fed fee imposed on the final bill. Please see attached documentation. Again, the late fee is the consequence of paying late, but, also again, we were waiting on the 'Final Bill' as Kelly stated there would be additional charges based on items they discovered during the inspection. We have never avoided paying anything, and would have paid what was truly due, had the inspection been completed when we moved out, and bef*** the end of the lease, but, they waited, and we had to take that. Our volleying back and forth extended in to October, due to no fault of our own. We left in August, and told them that, and was waiting on the 'Final Inspection' theref*** creating a 'Final Bill'. They should in good faith, do right by their tenants and remove these unreasonable charges. I am not even asking for them to waive the late fee, although they should considering it took them a long time to close this out. So, I will absorb that, but, I cannot see why they are saying according to the terms of the agreement, it stated court and fed fees to be imposed, and even if it did mention that, that is a vague statement with no amount attached to it. So apartment complexes can charge whatever they want to, which is unfair to tenants.

It took the company two weeks to fix the damage.

Because of this the ceiling in the kitchen fell. My family and I were not offered another apartment or a hotel to reside in until the repairs were finished. Repairs were slow and the property manager did not assist in getting them completed in a timely manner, After two weeks, repairs are now complete, but light fixtures still have not been replaced and I am still unable to see in my kitchen, padding has not been laid, and carpet upstairs has not been secured. To add insult to injury, our home was burglarized on July 9, 2020. All doors were locked and there was no forced entry, which led police to conclude that it was an inside job as the person responsible had to have a key to the doors. Sydnea R****** the property manager, has been less than helpful and has actually been quite rude and extremely unprofessional.

It ends up much more in the end. But the overall lease states that our well-being and health as far as maintenance and the upkeep of the apartments will be taken care of through this company which they have not done. It has been a bit of problems with them since we moved in. We were supposed to move in on the 1st of June but were unable due to another occupant tenant not wanting to vacate the premises. So our love in date was postponed. As of recently we were out fo AC from the 08/06/2022-08/15/2022. They claimed to have had all of there maintenance quit. I have two toddlers and we were completely out of AC for almost two weeks. On top of that, the tub is peeling and they said they would resurface but have yet to do so and there are two spots in the ceiling that are filling with water from the tenant above is and cause water stains and mold in the ceiling and all they did was come in and paint of the wet spots on 8/23/2022. As they said there was nothing else they could do. In addition to those issue, I filed paperwork to get my fianc put on the lease and it took them forever when they told me it would only take a few days, when I finally got a hold to the leasing office, they stated they had accidentally forgotten to file the paperwork, subsequently resulting in no decision for over a month.

Problems with Product/Service,1562796636,Resolved,09/19/2022,Business response,"I received your letter indicating a complaint had been filed August 24th and we had 14 days to respond. Unfortunately, mail has been extremely slow, and I did not receive this until today, September 14, 2022. 
They are correct about their move in date being postponed. When we receive move out notices, we start to market the available apartment. Unfortunately, the apartment they applied for had a resident that decided not to move and rescinded their notice to vacate. We contacted them as soon as we found out and told them we had another apartment that would be available June 2nd. They agreed to wait one day. (Lease attached showing start date of June 2nd) Attachment A 
They submitted a workorder for their A/C not working August 6, 2022. We had our maintenance technician go over the same day to see if there was something he could do. Unfortunately, it was determined that their A/C needed freon.  Both of our EPA certified maintenance techs had quit the week prior, therefore we were contracting our air conditioning calls with *****. Our air conditioning vendor had been contacted and they were not able to come out until August 15th. Our policy is to place a portable A/C unit in an apartment without air conditioning. I have attached the workorder (attachment B) and the invoice from Bryko (attachment C). Additionally, I have attached page 4 of their lease ******************************* lease) (attachment D) which states air conditioning problems are not emergencies. If air conditioning or other equipment malfunctions, you must notify our representative as soon as possible on a business day. Well act with customary diligence to make repairs and reconnections.  Rent will not ***** in whole or in part.  I have also included a document (attachment E) that states we do not provide compensation for maintenance and repairs. 
The resident contacted us regarding their tub. We contract out tub resurfacing with our vendor. An email was sent to our vendor after having a telephone call scheduling tubs that were in need of resurfacing.  This email was sent August 24th (attachment F). On August 31, 2022, an email was sent to the resident informing them the tub was scheduled for resurfacing September 6, 2022, I have attached a copy of the email (Attachment G). The tub was resurfaced September 6th; I have not received the invoice as of todays date. I have included a photo of the tub when the resident moved in; highlighting the area that had started to peel. (Attachment H) 
The resident had a leak coming in from the apartment above. Once the leak was repaired the ceiling was painted. There was no mention of mold in the workorder they put in the system (our residents have access to the resident portal that allows them to enter their own workorders) nor did our maintenance staff notice any mold. Weve not heard back from the resident since August 23, 2022, to state there was still an issue; workorder attached.  (Attachment I) 
It does appear ****************** requested her fianc be added to her lease June 16, 2022. (Email attached Attachment J). She is correct the money order and application were taken to the office June 18, 2022; however, it was not processed until July 27, 2022. Staff had apologized for the error.

I am rejecting this response because:
The manager blatantly said that she didnt know if it should be done because I no longer lived there. The email stated yes. She still refused to complete the application which could have eliminated any balance due and I would have received my full security deposit of $750 back. The $150 for trash pickup for one dresser, as well as, the so called late fee you charged me for moving out on August 1st.  Regardless of the amount owed it would have been $0 balance paid in full, like I had $0 balance before the day I moved if she took it upon herself to complete the application which she still has not done! I do not accept this and she didnt say what happened to the funds owed to me for always paying my rent on my own and housing decided to pay the last few months of $198 each four months. I never was reimbursed for the rent I paid when housing did pay some of my rent the last few months along with me paying the full amount owed. I need that money back and my full deposit because all this would have been avoided if she took the time to complete the application. Also, there was no food left in refrigerator the apartment was spotless besides the filthy carpet I dealt with for a year.

As set forth herein, Bell Partners has addressed the issues set forth in the complaint, and, as of the date of this response, the requested repairs have been performed.  As such, we consider this matter resolved.

With regard to Ms. ******’s concerns that her service response went unanswered—we regret that there was a delay in this matter.  Unfortunately, due to a missing character in Ms. ******’s May 31, 2023 service request email, the request was not received by the Property team.  However, when the team received Ms. ******’s follow-up email on June 5, 2023, the Property’s leasing manager immediately followed up with Ms. ******, and informed her that a maintenance employee would promptly inspect the unit.

That same afternoon (June 5, 2023), a maintenance technician inspected the window at issue, and discovered that it was not closed properly.  Ms. ****** confirmed that the window had been in this position (slightly open) since her move-in date of September 2, 2020.  During the June 5 inspection, the maintenance team placed a blower in the unit to begin the mitigation process.  The maintenance team followed up on June 6, 2023, to check moisture readings. While the sheetrock was dry at this time, the baseboard was still wet, and, accordingly, the team removed the baseboard for replacement.  The sheetrock and baseboard repairs were completed on June 9, 2023, and no further repairs are needed in Ms. ******’s unit at this time.

While Bell Partners regrets the slight delay in addressing Ms. ******’s service request, it is also incumbent on residents to notify the Property team as soon as an issue becomes apparent.  Bell Partners does not have a record of any maintenance requests regarding Ms. ******’s window prior to May 2023, notwithstanding her assertion that she was aware of the issue since her move-in date (September 2, 2020).  Moreover, the inspection from the Property’s maintenance team revealed that the window was not in need of repair, it had simply not been shut properly.   Regardless, the issues in Ms. ******’s apartment associated with water intrusion from the window have been repaired, and we consider this matter resolved.

Billing/Collection Issues,1593791407,Answered,06/09/2023,Business response,"On behalf of Bell Partners Inc. (“Bell”) and *** ***** apartment community (the “Property”), please accept this as our response to the complaint filed by ****** ********* on May 31, 2023. While we disagree with the narrative put forth by Mr. *********, we do appreciate the opportunity to provide a response.  It is unfortunate that Mr. *********’s application was denied; however, as set forth in greater detail below, that denial was the result of Mr. *********’s repeated failure to upload the necessary documentation in accordance with Bell’s standard application process.

Mr. ********* applied online for the Property on May 7, 2023, shortly after touring certain apartments with members of the Property team.  At this time, the team informed Mr. ********* what documentation needed to be uploaded for income verification via Bell’s third-party income verification provider, Snappt. Mr. *********, however, did not upload his bank statements via Snappt as required, but instead emailed his income documentation directly to the office staff.   In response, the Property team (again) communicated to Mr. ********* that it was necessary for him to upload his bank statements to Snappt as a required part of the application process.
Instead of following the required application process (even after being reminded of the Property’s process multiple times by the team), Mr. ********* drove to the Property’s leasing office and presented office staff with copies of his bank statements. At this time, Mr. ********* was reminded for a third time that he needed to upload the documents to Snappt. Mr. ********* was offered assistance by the Property team, and was given the opportunity to use one of the onsite computers to log into his bank and upload the bank statements. Mr. ********* stated he was unwilling to do so.

The Property’s community manager later spoke with Mr. ********* over the phone regarding the Snappt process and expressed yet again that the process needed to be followed; Mr. ********* at this point told the community manager that he was receiving an error message on Snappt. The community manager requested an email showing the error message that Mr. ********* received; however Mr. ********* did not provide any such email prior to the denial of his application.
In sum, Bell denies the allegations set forth in the Complaint by Mr. *********. The Bell team repeatedly communicated the necessary actions that Mr. ********* needed to take to complete his application, and Mr. ********* was given ample opportunity to correct and finish his application.  Because Mr. ********* failed to complete the application in accordance with Bell’s standard procedures, his application was denied.",https://www.bbb.org/us/nc/greensboro/profile/property-management/bell-partners-inc-0503-4006931

I said well I called and asked what I needed to do while moving out. They mentioned nothing about a reservation.

While we disagree with much of the narrative of this matter put forth by Mr. *****, we do appreciate the opportunity to respond regarding this matter. As set forth herein, Bell Partners has already provided this former resident with the requested refund; as such, we consider this matter resolved.

Mr. ***** first communicated with Andre B*****, the regional transitional manager responsible for overseeing the Property, regarding this matter on May 17, 2023.  Mr. B***** corresponded with Mr. ***** regarding his concerns, and, notwithstanding the fact that the Property team had acted according to its standard procedures with regard to the events surrounding Mr. *****’s move-out, Mr. B***** agreed to reimburse Mr. ***** for the full amount of the towing expenses ($149.00, plus a $3.50 ATM Fee).

With regard to the NSF fee referenced in the Complaint, during the above-referenced conversation, Mr. B***** agreed to refund $25.00 of the total NSF fee, and informed Mr. ***** that Bell Partners could refund the entire amount if Mr. ***** would provide a letter from his financial institution confirming that the overdraft was an error.  As of the date of this response, Bell Partners has not received any such letter.

Finally, Bell Partners denies the allegations in the Complaint regarding pest control issues or delayed maintenance responses, and Mr. ***** did not make any such similar statements to the Property team prior to the Complaint. 

Given that Bell Partners has provided Mr. ***** with the requested relief (a refund of the towing fee), we consider this matter resolved.",https://www.bbb.org/us/nc/greensboro/profile/property-management/bell-partners-inc-0503-4006931

Billing/Collection Issues,1593791403,Answered,05/11/2023,Business response,"This response is in reference to a complaint filed with the Better Business Bureau against Bell Partners Inc., the manager of the Bell ********** apartment community located in **********, ********, by Anthony *******, a resident of Bell **********.  We have reviewed Mr. *******’s concerns about his gas and water/sewer billings, and while we believe that he ws not overbilled, we are going to credit Mr. ******* account for all gas, water, and sewer charges since Bell Partners assumed management of the property for the reasons detailed below.

Mr. ******* has been a resident of what is now known as Bell ********** since April 2021 and continues to reside there currently.  When Mr. ******* initially moved into the apartment community, it was known as the Ridge at ********** and was owned and managed by a different company.  The new owner purchased the property on October 14, 2022, and retained Bell Partners to manage the property.  After Bell Partners assumed management of the property, it became aware that the data collector portion of the gas and water utilities monitoring system was not working properly.  The billings for gas, water and sewer were being estimated by a third party vendor that specializes in utility billings.  The vendor was using industry standard estimating techniques based on parameters such as property wide consumption, unit size, occupants, seasonal adjustments, etc.

Upon investigation by Bell Partners, it was found that the data collector for the property had ceased to function in September 2022, about one month before Bell Partners assumed management of the property.  A new data collector was ordered; however, it was not received and installed until March 2023.

Once Bell Partners realized the problems with the malfunctioning data collector, Mr. ******* was not billed at all for water and sewer charges beginning in November 2022, with the exception of one month (April 2023).  The April 2023 water and sewer bill was generated due to a change of personnel at the property who were not aware of Bell Partners’ decision to discontinue billings to Mr. ******* for water and sewer usage.  To date, other than the April 2023 water and sewer bill,Mr. ******* has not been charged for any water or sewer utilities since Bell Partners assumed management of the property.  Also, Bell Partners does not intend to charge him going forward for water and sewer until such time as Bell Partners is certain his water meter is recording actual usage.  In addition, Bell Partners will agree to fully refund Mr. *******’s payment for the April 2023 water and sewer bill in the amount of $52.31, which represents a refund of $32.66 for water and $19.65 for sewer billed on April 1, 2023.
As for the gas charge, notwithstanding it is believed the estimated gas charges are lower then the actual usage, Bell Partners is going to credit Mr. ******* account for all gas changes since the time Bell Partners assumed management of the property.  The gas credit will be $327.69.  Going forward, Mr. ******* will not be billed for gas utilities until his gas metering system is transmitting actual usage. 
Bell Partners regrets that the utilities metering system is still being repaired.  It is our hope that Mr. ******* will be satified that we have taken action to ensure he in no way has be overcharged for the services being provided.

Any overpayment charges to be identified and to be used towards future utilities or refunded for the amount owed
None of these items have been addressed or communicated.  While the credit amount offered from the property is appreciated this does not satisfy items requested.

Others that have submitted claims to the BBB on this same issue were not offered any credit or were rejected. 
Additionally, breach of the lease agreement has also occurred for many tenants described in detail below:
Under Section 11 of the Utilities Addendum it states ""You agree that you may, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice from Owner to you, begin receiving a bill for additional utilities and services, at which time such additional utilities and services shall for all purposes be included in the term Utilities""

                As of May 1st at 12 p.m., all HVAC issues were resolved and the system was fully operational. The issues that you were experiencing were caused by a “float switch” which has now been repaired.

Residents have been emailed on two occasions with an updated phone number to avoid the issue of the full voicemail box.  On Monday, May 1st, the Property staff emailed you to inform you of the repairs. They also spoke with your partner to apologize for any inconvenience and to provide you, again, with the updated emergency maintenance phone number.

They continue to place false reviews from google, and work to have legitimate reviews removed. Below was part of my revew that was removed, illustrating the basis of my complaint. 1. I was promised and told that I had a renovated unit at signing. That was untrue. I did have to pay 30 days of rent without living in the unit as it was the only way I would be guaranteed a unit on move in day. I also continue to pay the premium for the renovated unit that was not given to me. 2. Move in was delayed by 2 additional days as they forced me to sign for my keys in person despite paying rent for a month. The apartment had never been inspected. I had to point this out to management and fill out the inspection form and resubmit it 2 weeks after I moved in. 3. Move in day: the bathtub was full of water, the AC was not working at all, causing the unit to smell of mold, wax was peeling off of the floors, holes in doors and walls from what appears to be mounts from previous tenants, thermostat cover was removed, dryer dial was removed, windows were filthy and do not have screens. 3. Cable/internet is included in the tech fees for rent. I had trouble starting my cable as the previous tenant did not cancel their account, and the front office sent me a copy of my lease ONLY SIGNED BY ME. Come to find out I had signed 2 leases 1 electronic, one in person, both were misplaced. Unprofessional, disorganized. 4. Mail - proper access is not provided to Postal, and I have had several parcels take months to be returned due to the loop this causes.. 5.

Problems with Product/Service,1593791402,Answered,05/04/2023,Business response,"Dear Ms. *****,
On behalf of Bell Partners Inc., the property management company, for the Bell *********** apartment community (the “Property”) in ****** *******, we are sorry that we have not been able to resolve this issue and that you feel our previous response was inadequate. Please review the following response, which specifically addresses each claim that you have made:
1.  Neither Bell Partners Inc. nor the Property can manipulate or remove google reviews. Please contact google for any technical issues with reviews. We also do not allow or encourage false reviews or permit employees to post reviews. The Property may respond to reviews or encourage residents and guests to post reviews of their experience, as you have in the past.
2.  You have a non-renovated unit, and we have confirmed that the rent you have been charged is appropriate for a non-renovated unit. Renovated two-bedroom apartments that were available at the time that your lease was signed are priced at $130 or more than your rent. Based on this information, no rent adjustment is warranted at this time.
3.  Your move in date was delayed by 2 days because you did not initially appear in person to sign for your keys. As previously explained to you, part of Bell’s fraud prevention policy is that keys are only given to a new resident once their ID is confirmed in person. 
4.  Regrettably and as previously addressed in full, the Property acknowledged that the condition of your apartment was not acceptable at the time of move in, however, the on-site team immediately addressed all issues within 24-48 hours of discovery, and you were given a $250 credit to your account as a gesture of goodwill. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by the state of the apartment at your move in date, but the Property addressed those issues promptly and there are no outstanding issues.
5.  The Property has a master cable service contract with Spectrum that covers all apartments. Residents are responsible for establishing cable and internet service with Spectrum.  You were given Spectrum’s contact information at the time that you were approved to lease an apartment and advised to set up services in advance of our move in date. You need to address any issues that you have with cable and internet directly with Spectrum.
6.  When signing your lease our system updated and the electronic signature did not sync properly. As explained at the time of signing, this system error caused by the update resulted in the need for you to resign the lease. The Property never lost or misplaced any documents related to your lease.
7.  Mail facilities at Bell *********** are compliant with the USPS code. The property does not offer or advertise package delivery services. If you elect to have packages delivered to the property it is your responsibility to pick them up in a timely manner and failure to do so may result in the return of packages to the sender.
8.  There are three grills at Bell ***********. Two of the three grills are working and available for resident’s use. The grills at the pool area did stop working earlier this year, however, no one submitted a maintenance order, and the maintenance team found the issues during an inspection. The third grill requires replacement parts that have been ordered; the Property will return the grill to service once we receive the replacement parts. In the event that grills or other amenities are found in disrepair please submit the proper maintenance request so that these amenities can be repaired in a timely manner.
9.  The 24/7 business office is open and available to residents at any time via the key fob system. Residents may acquire log in information during business hours or upon request.
The property staff have tried to resolve each of the above issues and have attempted to address each of your concerns in multiple conversations in person, on the phone and through writing.

Problems with Product/Service,1593791399,Answered,03/30/2023,Initial Complaint,"In January I requested a lease negotiation meeting with the property management company to see why my lease rate was going up so considerably. Despite multiple phone calls, the management company did not get back to me about this meeting, and after more email requests responded saying my request for a negotiation meeting was denied. Following this denial, I requested an update of lease terms, as I was now within the terms for my lease renewal, at which point I was continuously ignored by the management company. The time to resign or move out had passed during this waiting period, during which they failed to even send me a new lease to sign in the first place. After visiting the office, I agreed to pay the month to month rate for march, with the verbal assurance given that my rate would be the first agreed upon rate for the six month lease I was quoted and provided with initially.

Ms. *******s complaint centers principally on certain fees associated with her application to the Property.  We are grateful for the opportunity to address the situation, and we believe that this matter has been successfully resolved.

Ms. ****** toured the Property on February 26, 2023, and applied that same day for a March 4, 2023 move-in date. Ms. *******s background screening was completed on February 27, and her application was approved.  Pursuant to the Property’s standard procedures, an applicant must pay a $100.00 reservation fee and a $300.00 administrative fee twenty-four hours after approval in order to hold a particular unit.  Unfortunately, Ms. ****** attempted to pay these amounts with a gift card, and the payment was declined.

On March 2, 2023, Ms. ****** telephoned the Property’s leasing office, and requested to delay her move-in date to sometime between March 15th and March 20th.  At this point, Ms. ****** still had not paid either the $100.00 reservation fee or the $300.00 administrative fee.  The leasing team informed Ms. ****** that her preferred unit was only available for move-in until March 12, and Ms. ****** selected that date (March 12) as her move-in date.

At this point in the process, Ms. ****** seemed to be confused about when her $400.00 total fee (the 100.00 reservation fee and the $300.00 administrative fee) was due.  Ms. *******s updated “Welcome Letter” was sent to her on March 2, and a draft lease was sent to her for review on March 6.  However, as of March 9, Ms. ****** had still not paid the fees required to reserve her desired unit.

On March 9, 2024, the Property’s community manager sent Ms. ****** an email communication, explaining that the total $400.00 fee was due twenty-four hours after approval.  As a goodwill gesture, however, the community manager informed Ms. ****** that the Property would permit her to pay the $400.00 on her move-in date of March 12.  Upon learning that Ms. ****** did not receive her payroll deposit, and at Ms. *******s request, that Property team allowed Ms. ****** to postpone her move-in date until March 15.

Ms. ****** paid the full amount due and moved into her unit on March 15, 2023.  Accordingly, we believe that this matter has been satisfactorily resolved.",https://www.bbb.org/us/nc/greensboro/profile/property-management/bell-partners-inc-0503-4006931

The Complainant’s principal contention in the Complaint is that the heat and air conditioning in her apartment needs repair.  As of the date of this Response, the Complainant’s repair request has been addressed, and we believe this issue has been successfully resolved.

After receiving the Complainant’s work order regarding the HVAC/heating unit in her apartment, the Property’s maintenance team performed an inspection of the unit, and ultimately determined that: 1) a replacement part was necessary in order to complete the repair; and 2) an outside vendor would be needed to install the replacement part.  Following this initial inspection, the site team acted quickly, and contacted the vendor to order the replacement part and to schedule the installation.  In order to allow the Complainant to maintain a comfortable temperature in the apartment, the site team provided her with a portable heater.

After learning that the Complainant was not satisfied with the portable heater, the Property’s community manager—Claudia *****—reached out to the Complainant to offer her the opportunity to stay in a hotel while she waited for the repair to be completed.  Ms. ***** reserved a room for the Complainant at the Hyatt Regency, which is located next to the Property.  The foregoing was offered to the Complainant as a customer service gesture, and the Property paid for the expense of the hotel stay.   The necessary part arrived on February 21, 2023, and the repairs to the Complainant’s HVAC/heating unit was completed on February 22.

As stated above, as of the date of this Response. the replacement part has been installed in the Complainant’s HVAC/heating unit.  The unit is now working correctly.

(“Bell”) and the ***** ** *** ***** apartment community (the “Property”), please accept this as our response (“Response”) to the complaint (the “Complaint”) filed by ******* ***** (the “Complainant”) on February 14, 2023.  The principal contention in the Complaint appears to be that Bell improperly failed to refund the Complainant’s $500 deposit.  Bell respectfully denies this contention.  As set forth in greater detail herein, after receiving notification from the Complainant that she had not received a refund of her deposit, Bell reissued the check, and per the Complainant’s instructions, the check is currently being mailed to the Property’s leasing office.

The Complainant applied for an apartment at the Property on or about November 26, 2022.  At this time, the Complainant paid an application fee of $75 and an administrative fee of $215.  Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the application, and in accordance with local law, the aforementioned administrative fee was only refundable in the event that Bell rejected the Complainant’s application.  The terms and conditions included as part of the Complainant’s application also made clear that she would be assessed a security deposit in order to reserve her apartment at the Property.

The Complainant’s application was approved on December 8, 2022.  Unfortunately, on December 15, 2022, the Complainant canceled her application.  In accordance with Bell’s standard procedures, the site team generated a Statement of Deposit Accounting (“SODA”) detailing the refund due to the Complainant, and on December 19, 2022, the site team mailed the SODA to the Complainant (at the address provided by the Complainant).  A refund check in the amount of $500 was issued (Check Number 4381) and mailed on December 21, 2022, to the same address provided by the Complainant.

On February 13, 2023, the Complainant contacted the Property’s assistant community manger (the “ACM”), and alerted the ACM that she had moved from the address previously provided to Bell, and had not received her refund check.  At this time, Bell requested a “stop payment” on Check 4381, and on February 14, 2023, a new check for $500 (Check Number 4570) was issued and sent to the Property’s leasing office for pick-up in accordance with the Complainant’s instructions. 

Again, at Bell we always endeavor to provide our residents and applicants with the best possible experience, and we regret that the Complainant was unhappy with the application process.

Problems with Product/Service,1593791393,Resolved,02/24/2023,Business response,"On behalf of Bell Partners Inc. (“Bell”) and the A**** ********* Place apartment community (the “Property”), please accept this as our response (“Response”) to the complaint (the “Complaint”) filed by ***** ***** (the “Complainant”) on February 10, 2023.  The Complainant’s principal contention in the Complaint centers on an unwanted “smoke” smell in her apartment.  While Bell is certainly sensitive to the Complainant’s frustration, at this juncture the site team—after taking the appropriate steps to attempt to address the issue, as set forth herein—has been unable to confirm either the presence of the smoke smell or, by corollary, which unit at the Property may be violating the Property’s “no smoking” policy.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in an effort to resolve this matter, Bell is willing to allow the Complainant to transfer to a different unit, or, if she would prefer, terminate her lease at the Property early.

The Steps Bell Has Taken To Address The Smoking Complaints

As an initial matter, while smoking is prohibited in all interior portions of the Property, Bell is unable to guarantee a completely smoke free environment.  This information was provided to the Complainant as part of the lease that she executed for her apartment, as the No Smoking Addendum made clear that “there is no warranty or guaranty of any kind that [the] dwelling or the apartment community is smoke free.”  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the comfort of its residents is of the utmost importance to Bell, and the site team acted quickly and appropriately to address the Complainant’s allegations of improper smoking.

In response to the Complainant’s initial call on December 22, 2022 regarding the smell of smoke in her apartment, the Property’s assistant community manager contacted the resident in the unit where the Complainant suspected the smell was coming from.  That resident adamantly denied smoking in or around the unit.  Following a subsequent allegation of smoking from the Complainant on December 29, the assistant community manager sent an email to all residents in the Complainant’s building, reminding them of the Property’s “no smoking” policy.

When the Complainant again reported the smell of smoke on January 14, 2023, a member of the site team called both of the units above the Complainant in an attempt to determine the source of the smell.  Neither of the residents reported smelling smoke.  On January 25, 2023, the Property’s community manager walked the entire Property in the course of conducting building inspections, but did not notice a “smoking” smell from any units. 

On January 31, 2023, the Property’s maintenance team entered every unit in the Complainant’s building for fire alarm inspections.  The team was specifically instructed to look for evidence of smoking during these inspections, and to be aware of any units with a detectable “smoky” smell.  The team did not observe any evidence of—or the smell of—smoking during these inspections.  Similarly, the Property’s maintenance team did not detect the smell of smoking while working in the breezeway near the Complainant’s unit for several hours (replacing lighting) on that same day.

During the overnight hours of January 31 through February 1, 2023, the maintenance team walked the Complainant’s building every fifteen minutes from 5:00 PM until 8:00 AM.  The team did not detect the smell of smoking during this period.  Nor, despite the Complainant’s allegations to the contrary, did the team detect the smell of smoking the following night (February 1 through February 2) while walking the Complainant’s building between the hours of 5:00 PM and 8:00 AM. 

As the above makes clear, the Property team has responded appropriately to the Complainant’s concerns, but they have not been able to verify any violation of the “no smoking” policy.  Moreover, the Complainant is the only resident in her building to complain about an alleged smoking smell.  In fact, a Bell team member that lives in the same building as the Complainant has not smelled—or witnessed—anyone smoking during that team member’s tenancy.  Without being able to identify the source of the smoking, Bell is simply not able to take any escalated measures against any particular residents. 

Proposed Resolution

As referenced above, at Bell we stive to provide our residents with the best possible living experience, and we regret that the Complainant is not satisfied with her apartment at the Property.  To that end, Bell is willing to offer the Complainant a transfer to another unit at the Property, with the transfer fee waived.  While we would hate to lose the Complainant as a resident at the Property, if she cannot locate another suitable unit at the Property to transfer to, we are also willing to allow the Complainant to terminate her lease early at the Property, with the early termination fee waived.

Problems with Product/Service,1593791389,Answered,01/23/2023,Initial Complaint,1. SAFETY- there’s homeless people in the woods and dumpster diving and they’re aggressive. I’ve called the cops and they can’t do anything. My girlfriend won’t walk our dog due to feeling unsafe. 2. Sanitary- There is mold in our apartment. We signed a mold addendum. But Chris ********** admitted to our unit having a faulty duct system and it being their fault. Which creates precipitation and eventually created mold growth in our unit. Additionally the trash is unreal our dog walking area is always covered In trash. If my dog were to eat something out here they’d get sick. Beyond that half the time it’s completely blocked by trash so I can’t even take our dog to that area. Kids used to play on the grass now they have no where either. 3.. Management- since moving in they’ve gone thru 3 managers at least. Each one gets worse and worse. Nothing ever gets done. They stop responding when you tell them what you need done. 4. Maintenance- we’ve had open maintenance requests for over 6 months now. They cut a hole in our ceiling due to mold said they were going to send someone out to check for more mold. Never did that. And there’s been a hole in the ceiling for MONTHS!! We have other service orders that they haven’t fulfilled. 5. Extra Fees- we get charged for extra trash pick ups which don’t occur. It’s a huge Ponzi scheme. We pay for valet trash plus extra trash pick ups. So about $60 a month. Multiply that by all units and it’s an insane amount for them to not be able to get it under control.,https://www.bbb.org/us/nc/greensboro/profile/property-management/bell-partners-inc-0503-4006931

While we thought the majority of concerns had been resolved, we’d like to schedule a time to meet in person so we have a better understanding of each concern.  We went to great lengths in December to resolve the trash issues and believed concerns related to the homeless populations were addressed in November.  In regards to the trash billing you mention, we have a charge for the valet and one for the trash haul removal from the property. We can appreciate that this may cause some confusion and we are more than happy to discuss this further when we meet.

He’s also an ESA(Emotional Support Animal). Based off my work schedule and payment schedule as well, some moths I have to pay later because of when each payday falls after the grace period.

I go back the couple days later that same week because I received court paperwork saying that I’m in the process of eviction because of failure of payment for that month. I spoke Joselyn ***** and she informed me they are refusing my rent payments because of the breed of my dog.

Unfortunately when went to move in on that day we saw bugs, messed up cabinets, scratched floors, among other issues. We called to get the apartment fixed and this took quite some time. We were told instead of a refund we’d receive credit as compensation and this was applied to our September rent. In retaliation to our apartment review they mentioned moving us to a smaller apartment, we declined. Afterwards we received an email about an additional credit we’d only have access to after signing a general release form. This credit was $547.26, we left this unsigned after reviewing the contract and weighing it’s implications. We paid September’s reduced rent of $1,620.51 as seen in the screenshot.

As is often the case the general manager was unavailable on following days for explanation. Today, September 19 he returned to work and we conversed through email.

Billing/Collection Issues,1593791376,Answered,11/15/2022,Business response,"On behalf of Bell Partners Inc. (“Bell”) and the ********** ***** ****** apartment community (the “Property”), please accept this as our response (“Response”) to the complaint (the “Complaint”) filed by ****** ********** on or about October 14, 2022.  Generally, Ms. ********** alleges that there were significant issues with her apartment at move-in, and that she was improperly billed by Bell.  Ms. ********** further alleges that the Property team offered her a smaller unit “[i]n retaliation” for an apartment review.  While we certainly regret that Ms. ********** was not satisfied with her move-in experience at the Property, we disagree with her portrayal of events.  Accordingly, we have provided an overview of the facts of this matter, set forth below.   Despite our contrary view of the facts of this matter, we value our residents’ property experiences, and, as set forth herein, we will work with Ms. ********** directly on a satisfactory resolution to this matter.

On August 20, 2022, the Property’s General Manager (Andre ******) received a call from Ms. ********** regarding an issue with the cabinets in her apartment during the move-in process.  Specifically, the cabinets were purportedly not installed properly, and were two different colors.  To be clear, the cabinets were the only issues in the apartment reported Ms. ********** to the Property team.  Mr. ****** assured Ms. ********** that the Property team would address the matter as soon as possible.  The Property team promptly made the repairs, and Ms. ********** was able to take possession of the apartment shortly thereafter.  Mr. ****** also offered Ms. ********** a rent concession, to compensate her for the delay in her scheduled move-in date.  Unfortunately though, it appears that Ms. ********** unilaterally imposed her own credit of $300—meaning she paid $300 less than her total rent balance owed.  At this time, the parties had failed to finalize their discussions regarding the concession, and the Property’s payment portal was not set up to apply a credit to Ms. *********** balance. After several discussions with Mr. ******, Ms. ********** paid the $300 shortfall on September 5, 2022.  Ms. ********** was never assessed any late fees associated with this amount.

To be clear, and as mentioned above, Bell values Ms. ********** as a resident at the Property, and we would like to ensure that we reach a satisfactory resolution here.  To that end, we are willing to offer her a rent concession in the amount of $547.26 to compensate her for the delay in her move-in date, and we will reach out directly to Ms. Wynderbur to facitlitate mutually agreeable terms of the agreement.",https://www.bbb.org/us/nc/greensboro/profile/property-management/bell-partners-inc-0503-4006931
Problems with Product/Service,1593791382,Answered,10/05/2022,Initial Complaint,"The two issues I have with Bell Partners, Inc are not providing livable conditions and failing to compensate me for the 13 days in which these conditions persisted.

Problems with Product/Service,1593791382,Answered,10/16/2022,Business response,"On behalf of Bell Partners Inc. (“Bell”) and the ******** ** ******* ***** apartment community (the “Property”), please accept this as our response  (“Response”) to the complaint  (the “Complaint,” with an assigned identification number of ********) filed by ******** ****** (the “Complainant”) on October 6, 2022.  The principal contentions in the Complaint appear to be: 1) that Bell created “unlivable conditions” and refused to repair those conditions; and 2) that Bell improperly refused to return the Complainant’s security deposit.  Bell respectfully denies those contentions.  While we certainly regret that the Complainant was not satisfied with her experience at the Property, Bell and the Property team acted in accordance with both their standard procedures and the Complainant’s specific directions with regard to this matter.  This Response will address each of the Complainant’s claims in turn.

On or about July 20, 2022, the Complainant reported a leak in her apartment.  The Property team acted immediately upon receiving the Complainant’s report, and the issue was addressed that very same day.  To be clear, the leak was repaired—and remediation was conducted—on the same day that the Complainant reported the issue to the Property team.  During the initial repair, the Property team noted that the leak had resulted in damage to certain sheetrock in the apartment.  Accordingly, the Property team scheduled a third-party vendor for July 25, 2022 (the soonest available date that the vendor could perform the work) to make the necessary repairs.  The Complainant, however, denied the vendor entry to her apartment on July 25, and instead requested that the sheetrock repairs be made after she vacated the apartment.  At this time, the Complainant had already provided Bell with her notice to vacate and was scheduled to move out on August 21, 2022.  Given that the leak had already been repaired, and in light of the fact that there was no danger or threat to the Complainant arising from the sheetrock, the Property team granted the Complainant’s request.  The repairs to the sheetrock were made on August 22, 2022, the day after the Complainant moved out of her apartment.

Bell also respectfully disagrees with the Complainant’s assertion in the Complaint that she was entitled to a refund of her deposit.  It is a bit unclear why the Complainant believes she is entitled to this refund, given that she states in the Complaint that she withheld her August rent apparently “knowing it would be deducted from the deposit.”  The Complainant is correct, and that is precisely what happened—the Complainant’s security deposit was applied to her August rent and final utility bill, which left a balance due of $23.94.  This accounting was documented in the Final Account Statement, which was provided to the Complainant in accordance with Bell’s standard procedures.  Regardless, the damaged sheetrock was not, by any means, a condition that would materially affect the physical health or safety of the Complainant, and the Complainant was not entitled to rent abatement or a refund of prorated rent pursuant to Texas law or the Property’s standard practices.

Again, at Bell we always endeavor to provide our residents with the best possible living experience, and we regret that the Complainant was unhappy with her time at the Property.  While we believe that the above satisfactorily addresses and explains the issues at hand here, as a customer service gesture Bell will waive the $23.94 balance that remained due after application of the Complainant’s security deposit.

She gave us the keys to view apartment 152; we fell in love with the apartment. When we came back to the office, we expressed how much we loved the place and was interested in renting. She then advised that someone else might have put in an application for it but inform us to go online and apply as well. She stated for me to go online and apply and then for my partner to go online and select the same apartment and apply. While I was trying to access the email she sent to apply she stated, “I’m not trying to kick y’all out but it’s 5 o’clock” and then she made the sound of a hostler when getting a horse to takeoff riding. We left out of the office and went online using my cell phone and applied for the apartment. I applied for the apartment with a move-in date of 9/20/22 and as soon as I submitted my $75.00 application fee I was immediately approved for the apartment and hit with the $250.00 administration fee and the $500.00 deposit. I advised my partner not to apply at the time because of what happened to me. I went to the office the following day to inquire why those fees came out of my account without any type of notification and Ronald/Donald advised the website states it will take those fees out, but the admin fee would be applied to our first month rent.",https://www.bbb.org/us/nc/greensboro/profile/property-management/bell-partners-inc-0503-4006931

The property's maintenance team addressed these repairs promptly.  At this time the resident expressed further concern about the kitchen cabinets doors not closing completely.  In response, maintenance completed adjustments to the kitchen cabinet doors.  There was no visible rust found inside dishwasher and no visible stains on drywall. On May 9, 2022, Bell Lighthouse Point hired a vendor, *******, to clean the air conditioning vents because the resident was concerned dust was blowing through the vents. 

On Friday, May 20, 2022 the resident submitted a work order via the resident portal at 10:09 PM.  The work order reported that there were maggots in the freezer and worms in the ice.  The Maintenance Manager responded on Saturday, May 21, 2022 at 10:22 AM.  The resident was home and she told the Maintenance Manager she saw a couple of “flies” maybe gnats.  The Maintenance Manager found the refrigerator, freezer, and the ice tray very clean.  No odors were detected.  (Pictures are attached.  Additional pictures available.)

The last work order received from the resident was on July 19, 2022 at 8:40 AM because they AC was not cooling properly.   The problem was addressed the same day.  We inspected the HVAC at move in and found it to be in clean, working order.  Residents are responsible for changing HVAC filters monthly.

So I reached out to the apartment complex to confirm. I asked if this was correct for a one bedroom and specified it was not a studio apartment. They confirmed via email that they did not have any studios available and it was the price for a one bedroom. So I believed them, I took time off of work to go look at the apartment. When I arrived, they told me that wasn't correct and wanted me to look at the $2000 one-bedrooms. It felt like being swindled for a timeshare.

Advertising/Sales Issues,1593791375,Answered,09/27/2022,Business response,"Dear Mr. ****,

We appreciate this matter being brought to our attention.  Bell Uptown Charlotte utilizes artificial intelligence (""AI"") technology in multiple facets of our prospective renter experience.  In this case, the agent Lacy that you interacted with was one of our AI agents.  Despite the AI agent’s assurance that the advertised pricing of $1242 was for a one-bedroom, it was for a studio.  Although our studio apartments are noted as “Studio”,  the AI agent, Lacy, interpreted the floor plan as a one-bedroom due to the reference to a bedroom/bathroom count of “1x1”.  Since your communication, we have been able to make an update to the back-end settings that allows us to notate studio floor plans as ""0x1"" so this issue will not present itself in the future.  

Our rental rates adjust daily and are based on several factors such as the number of available units. The best resource for current pricing and availability is the property website (https://www.belluptowncharlotte.com/floorplans/#/). We encourage prospective renters to check rates on the site often, and if they identify a home that fits their needs, move forward with securing the unit by completing the online application.

Thank you for the valuable feedback.

I have already informed Martin that I will notify him of my move out date no later than Friday. He let me know that is “so good, thank you” then slaps me with multiple emails - two of which I cannot even access - at midnight. That is purely unprofessional behavior and unacceptable.

I have emailed the staff requesting wages that are owed to me in which I also have proof of per a previous Regional Manager. I have also requested my personal items that their employees seemed to have “helped themselves to” per Martin. All I ask is that the on-site management team stops all communication with me as I am actively working on moving out. It is threatening, unprofessional behavior that I am aware every resident does not receive. On another hand, the corporate office at Bell Partners informed me, after offering zero support for a sexual harassment case at the hands of one of their managers who did receive their support, that I could return.

Problems with Product/Service,1593791371,Answered,09/07/2022,Business response,"The following is in response to Ms. ******’s 9.2.2022 communication.  In her communication, she raises several points that are false:

We did not fail to repair the AC unit within 7 days of complaint.  As an initial matter, Ms. ****** did not complain about the AC unit in her August 24 notice (see attached).  When the maintenance manager went to the apartment to investigate her August 24 notice, she mentioned to the maintenance manager that she thought the AC was the problem.  However, when the vendor inspected the apartment on August 26, the AC was working properly.  Thus, we did not fail to repair something that is working properly.  Also, as included in our prior response, the vendor found no signs of elevated moisture or visible mold in the unit contradicting Ms. ******’s claim that there is a problem in her apartment. 

We did not cover up mold in bathroom with paint.  In response to Ms. ******’s August 24 notice, the maintenance manager decided to clean the AC unit in her apartment.  However, while the maintenance manager was in her apartment, Ms. ****** contacted the office repeatedly to complain that the maintenance manager did not know what he was doing.  As a result, we directed the maintenance manager to leave the apartment, and we contacted a vendor (as discussed above) to address her apartment.  We did not enter the apartment again until the vendor’s inspection on 8/26.   We did not paint anything in the bathroom.  
Earlier in her tenancy (April 17, 20220), Ms. ****** submitted a work order for mildew behind the toilet.  At that time, the property contacted a vendor to evaluate the situation.  To address Ms. ******’s concerns, the vendor cleaned the air ducts and used a HEPA vacuum and anti-microbial scrub and fog.  Nothing was painted over at this time either.

We did not spray bleach in Ms. ******’s apartment to cover up mold before the ServePro service on August 26, 2022.  As noted above, in response to Ms. ******’s August 24 notice, the maintenance manager decided to clean the AC unit.  He started using water and AC cleaning soap -- he did not use any bleach – but Ms. ****** repeatedly complained that he did not know what he was doing so we directed the maintenance manager to leave the apartment.  We did not enter the apartment again until the vendor’s inspection on 8/26.   We never sprayed any bleach in her apartment.  We have no knowledge of anything that may have caused Ms. ******’s family to experience headaches.


Following her 9.2.2022 communication, Mr. ****** moved out of her apartment on 9.3.2022.  Ms. ****** requested to pick up her security deposit in person at the property, but the property informed her that the security deposit will be sent to her forwarding address in accordance with Florida law.  The only deductions from her security deposit will be her final water/sewer charge.  In addition, the property has waived Ms. ******’s rent for the period from September 1 to September 3.

Problems with Product/Service,1593791371,Answered,09/08/2022,Customer response," I am rejecting this response because:
In an effort to respond to Bell Partner's response, I would like to provide the BBB with a copy of the mold assessor's report which shows that Bell Partners is deliberately lying to avoid having to take responsibility for their mistakes. The AC was not repaired within 7 days. If that were true, they would have had to remove the mold in the apartment by September 1st, 2022, since their 7-day notice was issued to them on August 24th, 2022. This did not happen. See attached mold assessor's report dated September 2nd, 2022. It is clear that the problem was not resolved within 7 days per Florida Statutes. The report shows microbial growth in the HVAC, and the licensed mold assessor recommended that they remove building materials to find the source of the microbial growth. In addition, the mold assessor found elevated moisture behind the toilet in the guest bathroom and recommended for them to do a test cut to find the source of the moisture. Bell Partners says that I did not complain about the AC until August 24th which is another lie. See attached work orders which show that I clearly made a number of work orders concerning the AC. The AC never worked properly and was leaking according to the maintenance work orders which were placed. Bell Partners claims that the AC was always working properly which is false. The HVAC was never working properly. Actually, it was leaking if you look at the work orders that were made (see attachments). The coils were extremely dirty and old.  If the AC was in good repair, why does the licensed mold assessor's report say that they found microbial growth and why would they suggest for Bell Partners to remove building materials above the HVAC? The vendor that was sent to inspect the AC on August 26th was ******* which is a mold remediation company, not a licensed mold assessor. When you have mold, the first action that needs to be taken is to contact a licensed mold assessor to perform an air sample test.  This means that Bell Partners did not take the correct action by contact *******. ******* came to the apartment for 15 minutes and did a very simple inspection. They left without giving us any information. Bell Partners management office demanded ******* that they not speak to us or provide us with any information in regard to the mold. 
They claim that they did not cover up the mold in the bathroom with paint but that is actually another lie. The mold assessor's report shows elevated moisture behind the toilet and recommended for them to make a test cut to find the source of the moisture. They also said that they did not spray the bleach in our apartment which is another lie. I have an eyewitness who will be happy to testify that the maintenance manager sprayed bleach to try and make the mold appear not as bad. Bell Partners should reimburse me for the cost of moving into an apartment which was not suitable for residential use. In addition, they should reimburse me for my costs associated with moving out because of respiratory symptoms caused by the mold. I would also like to be reimbursed for my U-haul expenses, movers, and expense for the mold assessor's report. Failure to do so will result in further legal actions.

RE:  Complaint ID: *********

On June 28, 2022, ***** ******* applied for apartment ******* and was approved on June 30th , which she states in her complaint she was told she was approved.   The holding fee of $100 was taken out of her account which she authorized on the application she signed.  In our application it states, If you Fail to Sign Lease Contract After Approval.  Unless we authorize otherwise in writing, you and all co-applicants must sign the Lease Contract within 3 days after we give you our approval in person or by telephone or within 5 days after we mail you our approval, if you or any co-applicant fails to sign as required, we my keep the holding fee as liquidated damages, and terminate all further obligations under this Agreement. 

We do not see any notation or correspondence in writing from Ms. *******

I looked at the quote sheets it states $2155 for ******* for a move-in of 8/15, and that is what we had in our system. 

We do not see any notation or correspondence in writing from Ms. *******

Ms. ******* canceled the application after 3 days.  We check our messages 4 to 5 times a day and we return all phone calls.  After hours we have a call center that takes messages for us so calls are always answered, and we are open 7 days a week.  We did here from Ms. ******* on Friday, July 29th and one of our leasing consultants tried to contact her by phone and followed up with an email to Ms. ******* on Sunday, the 31st .

We did have the right quote and I don’t feel we did anything erroneous.  We held this apartment off the market for Ms. ******* and therefore, we do not feel we should have to refund the $100 holding fee.

Sincerely,

Billing/Collection Issues,1593791365,Unresolved,06/21/2022,Initial Complaint,"We were referred to Bell Four Points in Austin, Tx, by our apartment locator, who was very much aware of our apartment needs including, budget, and dates. On March 17th we toured the apt with Ms.D****, the asst. leasing mgr, and fell in love with one of the floor plans; Ms. D**** said she would be able to hold it for us until May 13th. On March 18th my fiancé and I submitted an application to move in on May 13th. The next day we decided to put in an application for the apt, however, while applying, the system did not allow us to enter our specific move-in date of May 13th, so we called again to confirm before proceeding with the application. At that time, the leasing agent that answered the call stated that a manual adjustment to the move-in date could be done once the application was submitted. Upon completion of the application, we called to notify the office that our application had been submitted and ready for the manual adjustment. This time Ms. D**** answered the call and informed us that the apartment could not be held until May 13th, because the system won't allow her to change it and that we had the apartment on April 1st. The April 1st move-in date was not acceptable to us as we would have been obligated to two leases. She then informed us she would talk to someone above her and best case scenario someone would put in their 60-day notice and we would have an apt. At this point, we were unwilling to take that chance and did not want to simultaneously be responsible for two leases. Therefore, we decided to stop payment, withdraw and cancel the application. Now, months later, we are being contacted and harassed by a debt collector, stating that we owe $550 to Bell Four Points in lieu of canceling the application. We filed a dispute against this claim and they, in turn, informed us that the claim was invalid because Ms. D**** said that she never promised us the move-in date of May 13th. We should not have to pay for the mistake of Bell Partners staff.",https://www.bbb.org/us/nc/greensboro/profile/property-management/bell-partners-inc-0503-4006931

I had previously had many issues with Bell Four Points including incompetent and neglectful maintenance breaking appliances in my home and leaving said broken appliances for weeks to months without any resolution, they did not try to resolve any problems I had while living in this residence. I spoke to the property manager when I moved out who told me I did not owe any costs and my rent was paid in full. Now months later, without any contact whatsoever from the property, I have been notified that I owe them money and they have sent me to collections. I never once received a notification from the apartment that there was any kind of outstanding balance so I was given no time to resolve this.

However, I was still requiring more proof since it doesn't prove that her neighbor was banging and needed a third party to validate the noise. I also let the resident know that we would be happy to come to her apartment to listen to any noise should it be during business hours. On 11/04/2021, the resident has made me aware that she had to call the police again for the banging noises overnight. I requested for a police report to confirm the banging again; We have not received any documentation for these visits. Resident is demanding to transfer to another community or on site transfer. I make her aware that because of her rental history with our community that she would not qualify to transfer to another community, but we would be willing to work with her to help with her situation. I originally requested for the resident to let me know which apartment she would like to transfer to and that we would need updated income for the transfer to ensure that she still qualifies for the apartment. My regional manager dismissed the need for updated income since she is transferring to the same floorplan for the same rental rate, but that she would still need to qualify based on our transfer requirements. Our transfer policy states that a rescreen is required if the resident does not have a satisfactory rental history with our community. Since the resident had an unsatisfactory rental history with Metro, I made he aware that she would need to be rescreened. The resident found this to be retaliatory for her complaint and demanded that we accommodate or she would be moving forward with legal action. On 11/05/2021 the resident made us aware that the noise was happening, so myself and Ashley went to her apartment to hear for ourselves. We had to put our ear to the wall in her bedroom to hear any noise. We did hear a low vibration noise, but could not confirm where the noise was exactly coming from. While in the breezeway, we did hear the apartment across from her playing loud music, so we addressed this and had the resident turn down the music. The complaining resident immediately came into the breezeway to let us know that the sound was gone and was adamant that it was her next door neighbor. Ashley and I let her know that the noise was coming from another apartment which we had addressed, which is why the noise went away. Between 11/03 and 11/05 I had reached out to surrounding apartments to notify of the noise being heard in hopes this would make them aware and help resolve the issue. All apartments involved responded with either not being home during the times that the noise was being reported or can confirm hearing the noise also. On 11/05 at 5:40pm one of the apartments that we contacted came into our office to let us know that the complaining resident came to her apartment and starting yelling at them about the noise, and threatened them with getting a lease violation. I reassured the resident that we were not issuing a violation at this time, but that we were still investigating into the noise issue since several apartments were being affected. The complaining resident contacted me around the same time the other resident came in to let me know the noise had continued after we left. I went back to the complaining resident's building and did not hear any noise. I still have yet to receive any police documentation as requested at this time. I have not received any emails or phone calls since Friday, 11/05 about the noise from the complaining resident. My assistant manager also did not receive any complaints by said resident over the weekend.

I should not have to keep calling the police if the company does their job and address the situation. The day you knocked on the door across from her she turned down the music because she has a ring light and can see that you are knocking at the person right across from her door. You never went to her apartment and knocked on her door at all. So please don’t lie. When I told you that she turned it up you never returned to my apartment at all. You can sit there and believe what they are saying but can’t believe me when I’m sending over multiple recordings and most of the recordings your saying you can hear through your computer.

Thank you for your concern. We were as surprised as our residents about the loss of water pressure yesterday. An email was sent to residents advising them of the situation as soon as the office was informed, with a recommendation to reach out to the City of Charlotte as this occurrence was not isolated to our community. Attached is the correspondence circulated by the city.

Over the course of this year, our community has only lost water one other time without warning – on 10/1/2021, we had to shut off the water to the community due to a maintenance emergency. This emergency repair was handled expediently, with the water pressure fully restored within two hours.

Communication is a top priority for our office, and I am sorry that your experience has been a negative one. We will continue to send out notice of any work being done in the community that might affect water pressure and inform residents of emergent situations if they arise. If you would like to discuss this further, please feel free to reach out to our office directly at 704 332 5022.

The apartment was leased in early July. At that time the applicant signed the lease and completed all steps for a move in on September 1st. The applicant called on the day before move in and wanted to extend 3 more weeks at the same price because he was waiting to hear about a Job offer. At that time the Regional Manager explained that we can do a couple of things for him. We could transfer his unit, release him without having to pay any reletting fee since he had not moved in yet or we could push back his move in but it would be at a higher price since we are on LRO, automatic pricing. The applicant stated that he wanted to be released, so we cancelled the move in for him. I did however let him know if he cancels the move in we do keep the application fee and security deposit. He was stating that was incorrect, so I sent  him the copy of the signed application where it states we will keep the deposit if he canceled after 48 hours. I also sent him his lease and any other signed documentation.

We typically do not cancel the move in after they have signed without penalty and we have kept the apartment off the market for a couple of months, but we did honor that request for him.

  Thank you for reaching out regarding the concerns expresses by **** ****.
  On July 15th  we received a call from **** **** questioning her balance at move-out. I requested she give me just a moment to review her account to properly assist. Upon reviewing her account I realized that she was being charged electricity along with a recovery fee for not having the utilities in her name. I told her perhaps it was turned off early due to the move and she should call Duke Energy directly to obtain copies of her bills. I explained that I could provide her with a credit on the vacant recovery if she could show proof that it was in her name. She agreed to call and said she would call me back.
  Later in the afternoon she call me back extremely irate because she said that we requested services to be placed in our name last year. She proceeded to say that, Matthew C******, prior leasing manager,   told her that this was normal protocol and she would have to pay electricity with her rent. Matthew C****** is no longer with the company. I can however state that Matthew was with community for over 3 years and was extremely knowledgeable in these process. I have never had a case where he gave anyone such information. All move in documents and the lease clearly state that the resident is responsible for connecting and maintaining there utility bills. The water bill she received from Conservice monthly clearly stated that she was being charged and electric recovery fee. While discussing all of this information with her on the phone she became increasingly irate and hung up on me.
  Attached I have provided a copy of the lease (paragraph 7), Utility Addendum stipulating the information outlined above. I have also provided a copy of a water bills where the fee is charged and explained in the billing description verbiage.
  Please let me know if you need any additional information as we are more than happy to assist.

They have not received a reply back to their email. I believe that Bell partners should contact Duke energy again to try and retrieve the information that states that Bell partners were the one who “transferred” our electricity into their name. This was not our doing and therefore we should not be billed for something that we did not do. The electricity was in our name and it was working just fine. We were never late on our bill with duke energy for them to transfer it to Bell partners. No one in their right mind would want to pay a monthly fee of $25 if they don’t have to. And in our case, we didn’t have to. But Bell partners didn’t give us a choice when they decided to transfer our electricity into their name without informing us of the transfer and of the monthly fee that we would be incurring. This isn’t fair practice and I believe Bell partners can do a better job on retrieving that information from Duke energy.

Problems with Product/Service,1593791341,Answered,06/30/2021,Business response,"We were previously made aware of this complaint from the Resident, our On-site Office, Corporate Office and Towing Vendor on the date Ms. ******* was seeking compensation for her vehicle being towed for violating posted towing policies. Ms. ******* was illegally parked in-between two spaces, a vehicle and motorcycle parking space, and was subsequently towed by the authorized tow vendor for the Apartment Complex.

Ms. *******’s complaint requests to have been warned before her vehicle was towed for violating the parking rules.
Upon moving into our Community, a Lease Agreement was signed by Ms. ******* that indicated she would follow Community Rules and Policies. New Towing and Parking Pass Rules were put into effect April 2021 which Residents were required to sign before receiving a new parking pass (document attached). Ms. ******* has a parking decal displayed on her vehicle as shown in the pictures attached.
Conspicuously posted towing signs are displayed throughout the Parking deck at **** ***** ***** in accordance with County Regulations which clearly state “Towing enforced for: …….taking 2 spaces or double parked…”.
Ms. ******* was notified on several occasions of the parking rules.

Ms. ******* claims to have been told “too bad” regarding her vehicle being towed is inaccurate, as were not given the opportunity to work with Ms. ******** towards a solution with her behavior and repeated phone disconnections.
Ms. ******* contacted the Community Manager, myself, regarding the situation and requested the towing fee be waived. When Ms. ******* was informed that she was in fact illegally parked and not erroneously towed, Ms. ******* hung up the phone and did not answer upon a return call. Ms. ******* then called the Corporate Office, Bell Partners with another resulting disconnection of the phone conversation; and subsequently called another two times with similar results.
Ms. *******’s co-lease holder did contact the Leasing Office later in the day and spoke with the Community Manager, myself, regarding the issue at which time I did express our understanding of the heightened animosity regarding the situation and offered to provide a 50% credit towards the County Mandated towing Fine of $150. The Credit was placed on Ms. *******’s account that day.

Ms. *******’s complaint cites other vehicles were parked over the line; these vehicles were verified with the Tow vendor and in pictures to be parked on top of the line, not over the line. A violation of Community or Parking Rules is not justified through citing another person’s offense and as detailed above, was not the same violation.

Ms. *******’s complaint regarding Handicap parking spaces are without merit; these spaces are monitored by the Towing Vendor and have had vehicles towed from these spaces previously. Electric Vehicle parking follows the same rules as Resident spaces in the Parking Garage. Our Contracted Towing Vendor monitors our Parking Garage at unspecified times and intervals and is not a 24/7 monitoring of violations in the Parking Garage which would be unreasonable.

Regarding the claims of mold and water leaks in Ms. *******’s home, there is no record of such occurrences with the On-site Management Team since management take-over in November 2020. Prior home-work history for Ms. *******’s home (since November 2020) does not detail any incidents of mold or unresolved water leaks. Per Ms. *******’s lease agreement, it is the responsibility of the Resident to notify Management immediately of any mold growth or leaks so that any necessary work to address such issues can be completed in a timely manner.

Ms. *******’s complaint regarding Fire Extinguisher’s not being up to code holds no merit and the Community follows all County Requirements. Annual inspections are performed in accordance with the County Regulations and COVID protocols.

Problems with Product/Service,1593791336,Answered,01/13/2021,Initial Complaint,"I was billed by the landlord, 25 days after we move out & they did not do move out inspection although we asked them when we return the key. I need advice, regarding my complaint and objection about charges after 25 days we moved out from ******** @ ********* ************* ********** ****** ********** *** *****. manage by Bell Partners The chronology: 1. We rented 1 br to ******** at Brentwood on my first contract for 13 months, which is from July 26th, 2019 to August 25th, 2020 for $1.485/month. 2. For the first 4 months, we were in apartment unit 300-255 because we asked to be placed in an apartment not facing the pool; instead we got the one facing the pool by mistake. We initially refused but with their apology we accepted because they said they don't have an available unit at that time and after 2 more months we were requested to move to unit 300- 204 which we must to upgrade and paid more money even though that was their mistake. 3. Before we move into unit 300-204, ""the property management asks us by email more than one month before, on August 23rd and 25th 2020"", to walk through check the current condo"" (300-255) schedule on 08/28/2020. Because we have work that day, we ask to reschedule it on 08/29/2020. (Copy No.1 2, 3 & 4). 4. Sometime in early of August, I called the Property Manager Linda, for my plan to extend the unit until November 2020. Because we were looking for a place near our workplace, we decided to buy a home and my closing date was 11/23/2020, so we told them we needed to extend our unit for 2 more months. On 11/11/2020 the property manager sent me the new price and we still accepted the price from them even though they were unable to give us the same rate, as a result they charged me a monthly rate and we paid more as $1.767/month. (Copy No. 5) 5. On 08/14/2020, ""we sent them again written email confirmation"" to the property management regarding my plan to extend the condo not later than month of ""November 2020"". (Copy No.6) 6. On 10/13/2020, we give them the final date; 11/24/2020, we are going to move out from the condo by written letter to the office also by e-mail to the Property Manager Linda. (Copy No 7 and 8) 7. On 11/24/2020 or the day when we move-out, with my family's best effort and with my clean knowledge to clean my condo but still did not receive any communication, letter or e-mail from the Property Manager nor the Management Staff, if they have plans to walk through to our condo. With our good will when we return all the keys and door fob, ""we once again"" asked to the property staff (A.J) if he need walk through or move out inspection to our condo together with me to check for any damage or unclean before we leave and is there any outstanding bill, but he just said to me; ""No, You good to go, and no outstanding fee, only the water, sewer and power bill that we used need to paid off"", we paid the water and sewer at that day. 8. On 12/18/2020, or 24 days after we leave the condo, we get an email and notice from the Manager that we have some charges. The manager mentioned the cleaning fee and the damage to the dryer. (Copy No.9). 9. On 12/19/2020, I replied to her email where we are not liable anymore for that unit (because they did not perform any Move - Out Inspection before, on the same day or 4 days after the unit was vacant). (Copy No. 10) 10. I never got any reply from her until again with my good will, on 12/22/2020, we stopped by the office and met with Emily (the staff), because Linda had left earlier so we left a notice to Emily to ask her Manager to check and reply to my email. 11. On 01/05/2020 (after 14 days) we still did not get any information from the manager, once again with our goodwill we visited the office, met her and told her the reason if we objected with the charges and asked her to waive all the charges were we not liable.

Problems with Product/Service,1593791336,Answered,03/02/2021,Customer response," I am rejecting this response because:

The resident in question was spoken to on numerous occasions in regards to the charges he is disputing.  First, once a resident moves out, the property has 21 days to send them a final account statement.  This was done accordingly. 
I try to find from the Apartment Lease, but I still cannot find a statement saying the property has ""21 days"" to send the ex-tenant for the final account statement. Please inform me which paragraph, page, and/or number? But why did the other property manager say in her email to me, the delay caused by the weekend, holidays and Covid-19 issues?
The keys were turned in over a weekend in which A.J., did inform that they “were good to go”.  A resident does not have to be present for the final walk through of a unit.
I returned the key on Tuesday, November 24, 2020 and that is not the weekend.
When I read from the lease agreement, tenants have the ""right to be present"", with their representative for mutual move out inspection and set by the management for the date. But that does not occur, I never receive any email nor invitation for mutual move out inspection to determine any damage before and after I move out. If so please send me a copy of the email as when we transfer from unit 255 to 204 in August 2019.
When the official employee Mr. A.J, said “No, You good to go, and no outstanding fee, only the water, sewer and power bill that we used need to paid off”, that phrase is : I clear to move out, ready to leave or ready to get out. Nothing is outstanding except the bills.
During the final walk through substantial damages were noted. 
Not both parties doing the final walk through and those damages are in doubt.
We only charged for cleaning and the replacement of a dryer top.  Because the residents did not properly care for the unit or run the HVAC, there was substantial damage to the refrigerator (replaced fridge door), walls, carpets, and the bathroom vanity had to replaced.  I have attached pictures below.
Which photo number is related to the damage of the dryer top?
I take good care of the unit, as my family lives in this unit, I never harm my family health.
What kind of damage is caused by not running the HVAC?
For the fridge door, is that oxidized stain? that easy to clean with baking soda and water or vinegar, no need to replace the whole door.
Walls, carpets and the bathroom vanity, that was normal wear and tear, for the door of the vanity inside the bathroom, may be that part do not have a good quality when the carpentry was made, if it damaged by me, not just only 1 door but the door next to it will be damage too.
The appliances and furniture are not new when I rent, it is rented many years to other tenants before me.
Also, no occupant below the years of 18 years of age are considered a lease holder, only a occupant.  While the resident refuses to pay the very minimum damage charges, there were much more that they should have been billed for.
For the business, they can say $251.18 is a minimum damage charge, but for me this is a big amount and anyhow this is not supposed to be.

Delivery Issues,1593791334,Answered,10/28/2020,Initial Complaint,"My complaint with Bell Partners, INC is my lease agreement. On 09/23/2019, I received my online lease application agreement via DocuSign. The lease application agreement stated that my lease was to end on 02/08/2021. The agreement outlines in-depth the terms of the lease. While browsing on my apartment portal I realized that they had my lease end date incorrectly online. I went to the office to speak them in person about my grievance. The representative then referred me to Aisha P****, Assistant Community Manager. I sent an email on 10/24/2020 regarding my concerns with my lease. On 10/27/2020 Aisha P**** reached out to me stating that my lease agreement stated that my move-out date was 4/30/2021. She sent me the documentation of the signed lease via email. I told Ms. P**** that all other documentation that I had received from the property has a lease end date of 02/08/2021. Ms. P**** stated she was unable to help me. My issue is that it is evident that what I'm saying is true. I have my application that states that I applied for a 15 month lease. On 11/03/2019 , 13 days before my move-in date I received a move-in statement that also states my move out date is 02/08/2021. 17 and half month lease is unlikely. When I moved in that was not a lease option. I had the option of a 12 month or 15 month lease. I presented all of these documents to Ms. P****, but she stated she was unable to help me. This is a shady business practice. It is obvious that there was a clerical error. I have evidence to support that my move-out date is 02/08/2021 and Bell Partners, Inc. refuses to honor it. To rectify this issue, I would like my lease agreement to reflect what I applied for and what my move-in statement reflects. Bell Partners, Inc. had the opportunity to do the right thing, but yet chose not to.

Problems with Product/Service,1593791333,Answered,10/20/2020,Initial Complaint,"I rented an apartment in Kissimmee, FL early in November of 2019. The first weekend we had problems with our upstairs neighbors and contacted the management company. We were advised they would handle and that our neighbors had never had anyone living under them. The noise got better for some time. When Bell Partners came in and starting managing the property things got much much worse. We could hear machinery running at all hours of the night. We reported this continually to management and never got any response. Finally management advised us that the neighbors were running a mask making business. They were running sewing machines and moving furniture to operate their business. Our lease contract states that you can not operate a business. Management finally contacted me in the middle of August and stated that their attorneys would have the tenants evicted within 30 days. Its been over two months and still nothing has been done. Many nights it sounds like a zoo. I have probably contacted management in Kissimmee or at Bell Partners 40 times or more and basically just get ignored. We now understand that our neighbors will be staying until November 14. We have asked that our lease just be cancelled but that has been declined. I think if I was Hispanic this would play out different. I would like to have the final three months refunded due to our continual problems. I have reached out, left messages, and emailed everyone listed with Bell Partners and just keep ignored. I had a stroke in July, largely due to this stress.

  I am replying to the attached BBB complaint for ******* ******* ****.  The complainant, Mr. ***** ******* emailed the Community Manager Dayami R**** on June 19th 2020 to make her aware of his concerns regarding the neighbors who lived right above his apartment.  Ms. R**** reached out to the residents to let them know there had been a complaint received in the office regarding noise from their apartment.  At that time, Ms. R**** discovered that the residents were sewing face masks for Covid in their apartment and the sewing machine noise was bothering Mr. *******.  No other residents ever complained to the office.  Ms. R**** let the residents know they would have to stop the noise not because they were “running a business” out of their apartment but because the noise was bothering their neighbor.  Running a business would involve customers coming to their apartment which was not happening in the instance. 
  Ms. R**** let Mr. ******* know that she had reached out to the residents and she had asked them to stop using their sewing machine.  What Mr. ******* fails to understand is that we have landlord/tenant laws we have to follow which does not allow for us to kick someone out whenever we please which is what he kept demanding in his 5 emails in August, 9 emails in September and 5 more emails in October.
  Ms. R**** sent a non- renewal letter to the residents who were sewing whose lease expired in November.  These residents moved out of their apartment on 10/31/2020. 
  Please let me know if you have any questions.

The person I initially was dealing with was Holly H*****. They treated me as if I was a criminal. My Mom and Dad has owned an accounting firm for 30 plus years and I work for them. Our business pays me very well and Holly and Tracy B**** treated me like a robbed a bank after they saw the income I bring in monthly. Holly went beyond searching my information. I listed on the application an Alabama address as my previous rental history only, which means I no longer live there. My drivers license shows my mailing address. Holly H***** assumed I lived at the address on my drivers license and called the Apartment complex my mom lives at to verify residency when I do not live there. This appeared to be a poor gesture, more of a stalking mindset. Holly H***** and Tracy B**** requested my bank statements to prove I have deposits in the amount of my payroll going into my account and their policy does not require this information. Holly and Tracy B**** only requested this because they were under the impression a nice looking Black African American could not be making this kind of money. After discussing their actions with my mom and dad, they recommended that I do not live at a place that shows this type of harassment and high monitoring of me this early in the application process, and requested that I have them refund me my $75 application fee. Tracy B**** called me and said she requested my check be mailed to an Alabama address, an address I only listed to show proof of prior renting, this is not my current mailing address. This was deliberately done because I ask for a refund and stressed how rude and singling out they were towards me.

We requested 2 of the most recent paystubs to verify employment.  The paystubs had errors on them.   At the bottom they listed direct deposit.  We asked to see the bank statement deposits that matched the paystubs to confirm the errors we discovered were not due to fraudulent documents.  We were refused the paystubs by the applicants mother.
  We verify rental history on each applicant.  This applicant listed an Alabama address on the application as a current address.  She listed she was renting from a private owner that she would not provide the contact information for.  This address did not show up as an address attached to this applicant on the credit report.  To complete the rental history verification portion of the application we reached out to the current address on the credit report which also matched the address on the driver’s license. 
  I reached out to the applicant twice by email to verify where she would like the refund check to be mailed and after 2 days with no response requested it be mailed to the current address she listed on her application in Alabama.  An additional 2 days passed and the applicant finally responded by email giving me an Atlanta address to mail the check to, so a stop payment was made on the first check and a new one was processed and sent to the Atlanta address.  The only fee this applicant paid to us was a $75 application fee and that was refunded.  We do not have any $99 fees in this Community that she is also asking to have refunded.
  We do not have any affiliation with ******** apartments so their denial of the applicant was not based off of any information from this Community.

The leaseholders mentioned above submitted a Notice to Vacate (attached) to the leasing office on July 1, 2020 stating that they would be terminating their lease agreement early on August 1, 2020 due to financial hardship caused by Covid-19.  The lease holders chose option #1 Liquidated Damages or the early termination fee of two times the lease rent amount as the early termination of lease contract .  Given the reason for lease termination was cited as financial hardship as a result of Covid-19 ownership approved a reduction of the penalty for early termination of ½ (50% or equal to one months rent).  ******* ***** inquired what the penalty would be when she returned the attached Notice to Vacate on July 1, 2020 during a conversation with the Community Manager, **** ******, who made her aware of the fees involved and that we would be discounting that fee by 50%. 
  During the final apartment inspection the front entry door was found to be damaged (photo attached) which required being replaced and they were charged $400 for this damage as well as  a final utility bill of $99.00, one day of a rent prorate in the amount of $49.00.  These charges along with the discounted early termination fee of $1519 total $2,067 minus the $250 security deposit bring the total due to the property $1,817.  The final account statement was sent to the forwarding address left by the lease holders at *** ******** ******* **** ********* ** ***** via certified **** mail on 08/15/2020. 
  Both the Community Manager and myself have spoken to Mr. ******** via telephone detailing each charge and how we came to the final amount.  Mr. ******** disputed that the front entry door that he was charged for was his apartment because the address was not visible in the attached picture.  Given the difficulty in us being able to prove this door belonged to apartment #****, I agreed to remove the $400 charge from the collection account during a conversation I had with Mr. ******** on Thursday September 24, 2020 which reduced the total due to the property to $ 1,417. 
  It is our continued position that the reduced lease termination fee, final utility bill charges and prorated rent are due to the property by the leaseholders and as in our normal business procedures this account was sent to collections in an effort to collect this debt.

Regarding the finishes in the home, while it is absolutely never our intention to purposely mislead a prospect during the leasing process, we understand that miscommunications may occur, and we regret if that is the case here.  We did speak to the leasing agent that you worked with, who recalls narrowing down our available options with you, discussing a renovated unit that was available sooner and a nonrenovated unit available at a later date and at a lower rate; you opted to wait for the nonrenovated unit.  Our model home, which is pictured in marketing materials, our website, and other internet listing sources, is a nonrenovated unit with finishes (wall color, plumbing fixtures, lighting fixtures) similar to the home you leased with **.  As for the differences between the apartment you toured (a vacant 2br) and the home you leased (a 3br), the additional bedroom and linen closet were the only differences between those two with regard to floor plan; finishes may vary from unit to unit.  Our leasing agent contacted you the day prior to your scheduled move in to offer you an opportunity to view the specific unit that you leased, and you opted not to do so.

 As for the cleanliness of the home and maintenance issues, our team completed our standard turnover procedure, followed by a final walk-through inspection the day prior to your move in.  We found the unit to be in move-in ready condition.  Photos from that walk through are attached.  While our goal is to make each unit feel fresh and clean, all of our apartment homes have been lived in previously.  Of course, we are happy to correct any outstanding maintenance issues that you discover at move in or at any time during residency.

Upon learning of your dissatisfaction on move in day, we presented you with the following options:
- Switch to a currently available renovated unit, at the going market rate.
- Cancel your move in altogether, and part ways with ******************** (option only available during a specified time frame).
- Keep the home you originally leased with **, allowing our maintenance team the opportunity to correct reported issues.  We also scheduled a cleaning company to come out and reclean the unit.

Problems with Product/Service,1590526415,Answered,05/01/2023,Business response,"I am in receipt of your customer care inquiry regarding the issues you are experiencing with your neighbors.  First, I am sorry to hear that you continue to be disturbed by your neighbors. 

I have reviewed your communication log in our system as well as the communication we have had with the neighbors.   It appears that we have addressed your concerns with the neighbors several times and the assertion is that the sounds are normal apartment sounds.  I tried to hear the noise in the audio recordings in the account but was unable to hear any unreasonable noise.   

In order to proceed with further action against any party we need verification that the noise is unreasonable.  Does this occur during office hours so a team member can come over and listen?  If so, please let ** know when it happens and we will try to make it over there before the noise stops. The courtesy officer should be able to verify any unreasonable noise after hours.

Unfortunately, without independent verification that there is a lease violation occurring it is difficult to address the issue.  We are prepared to enforce the lease however please understand that if there is no lease violation (unreasonable noise) we can only request that neighbors be considerate of each other.

I know that **** has offered to let you transfer with no fees and that you do not wish to avail yourself of that offer.  We will offer the same to the neighbor when we follow up with them.

I am rejecting this response because this pricing is not being imposed on me as a premium for holding onto the apartment, and exercising an early termination privilege with no notice, which is what this rate is intended for.
I am being charged this early termination premium for simple lease overlap with a real estate closing, which I made clear to MAA in writing and verbally, may occur, as I was nearing completion of a home purchase.
MAA has chosen to treat me like a number after 4 1/2 years of prompt rent payments.
As MAA has chosen to respond by not offering flexibility during this transition-out period, I would ask that this complaint remain on file as Unresolved for MAA, to assist future customers in their renting decisions.

Problems with Product/Service,1590526411,Answered,04/25/2023,Business response,"The below communication has also been sent to ****************. Our position is that full replacement cost for the carpet was supported due to pet damage and wall repairs are supported as well. We have already offered **************** much reduced charges than supported. While we will not be able to further reduce her Final Account Statement, we have offered to allow an extended payment plan to help further. 
E-mail Response to **************** sent on 4/25: 
Good afternoon *****,

Please know it is certainly not our intent to upset you with any damage charges that *** be applied to your account. When damages are present, which result in additional cost (above and beyond) what would be considered normal wear and tear, and taking into account the life expectancy of certain items, those additional costs would be passed to you.

I have thoroughly reviewed all documentation surrounding the condition of your apartment home. While I want to thank you for leaving the apartment clean, there were significant costs associated to us above and beyond what would be considered normal wear and tear.  

Wall Repairs While we can also appreciate the effort made to try to fill the holes, this often does more costly damage when not done professionally. Each area had to be repaired and retextured which resulted in a charge of $385 above and beyond the normal scope of repainting your apartment home.  
Carpet I see that ******* and ****** have already agreed to try to help you with this as a courtesy, but having reviewed the details and photos of the damage, to be *****, I would not have supported the same significant reduction they have already applied for you. (Notes below)
Carpet was brand new when you moved in (replaced on 8/13/21). This apartment home was vacant until you moved-in on 2/4/2022.
** just 14 months (20 moths including the vacancy), there was quite a bit of pet damage done to this carpet. I hope you can appreciate that we would not be able to move a new resident into an apartment home with carpet in this condition.
** the Cleaning and Damage Cost Form (you yourself have referenced from your lease), this charge would be at the FULL replacement cost which we incurred at $1,929.47.    
The discrepancy here, is that the team was preemptively trying to be as gracious as possible and elected to only charge you 60% of the replacement which was only $1157.68.
I see they additionally, went above and beyond and ultimately decided to reduce this further for you to only the actual carpet cleaning/repair invoice that we also incurred during our attempt to try to clean vs replace the carpet for you. Total of $216.45. (Note - The $65 as outlined in your lease for a 3-bedroom is for a standard clean only and does not include any repairs or additional stain or spot removal).

At this point, I am confident the team has provided you with a highly reduced Final Account Statement balance vs what is supported so we will not be able to reduce this Final Balance for you any further. While I understand your position in not agreeing to the charges of the wall repairs, I certainly hope the reduction of $1,713.02 from the carpet replacement, that should have been charged is enough of an acceptable settlement in this matter.I do apologize for what you feel are discrepancies, however, please know these were attempts to offer you the best reduction as possible on your final account statements.

While I would not be able to support any further reductions to your Final Account Statement, if you would like to set up a payment plan, I can approve for you to have an extended payment plan (up to 90-days after move-out) over 3-equal payments set up for you as an additional courtesy.Please let me know.

I am rejecting this response because:
So the other part was that in the comparison report for the walls in every room on the report it states the paint was fine. When we moved out of **** we covered the holes on the same manor with the same spackle and we were not charged. There were already damages that were in pictures that were provided at move in and one that even the staff took that showed there was already damage. The comparison report does not match what is being charged.  It cannot be okay in the report and then charged on the **** That is the point of the comparison report right? On the invoice there were charges for holes but there were not any holes. There would also not need to be any sanding maybe retexturing but since the paint color was being changed any way they were going to have to do retexturing anyway.
The carpet was already busting at the seams and they were trying to charge for that as it was in one of the pictures. The carpet also had bubble in the carpet that needed to be stretched before we move. In the email from ******* she stated that she was only going to charge me for the cleaning since that was what was allowed by the lease.

I received this communication regarding a current resident residing at MAA ************ in *******, **. We have reached out to Spectrum along with our Senior Vice President over ancillary(houses the bulk cable program) to ensure we are not over charging this resident. The resident moved in this year and has paid two months of the cable package. As with all applicants, we review the package up front and explain all fees associated. We also require the new resident to sign a waiver acknowledging this package we offer along with the price. 
 After further research, our rep from Spectrum has reached out to the resident to help facilitate his concerns based on his employers discount. Please see communication below specifically from our rep...
I validated a few items and confirmed the resident/Spectrum employee isnt prohibited from the mobile discount. I tried to reach them over the phone however wasnt successful. I followed up with an email to set up time to resolve.

Al
 Further communication from our SVP over ancillary states the below...
I escalated to Spectrum to confirm the yellow highlighted portion below.   From what I recall, Spectrum does not honor that.
I would liken this to any other employee benefit a company provides; however, not every associate takes advantage.  MAA offers a discounted rent price if I were to reside in a MAA apartment home but I voluntarily decide to live elsewhere.  This resident voluntarily chose to reside with MAA and as part of the residential lease agreement, they agreed to terms and conditions of the MAA *************** regardless of employer benefits provided.

Complaint: 19602057

I am rejecting this response because:
I have not received any emails to set a time up to facilitate my employee service account. I would like that at the very least. I tried to call back shortly after missing the Spectrum reps call but was sent to voicemail. 
I would also like to provide proof of the condition to being eligible for the mobile benefit. I never said I was prohibited but there is the condition that I must automatically be enrolled in a second internet and cable package (the reason for paying 2 packages now). This definitely needs facilitating.
If that can be resolved than I agree I have chosen to reside somewhere with a spectrum package regardless of my employee benefits as it was before I was given true information on MAA not having to foot or be burdened by my connection costs. I simply thought it reasonable to request it be removed if it in no way hinders them financially why wouldnt they want to do something in good interest of their residents as they claim in their mission statements. Especially when they have struggled to have a good rating. I am a firm believer in not harming a businesss reputation with my opinions and I dont intend on it but after my car being hit by their poorly hired maintenance man on a gulf cart and now this I believe they have earned their terrible ratings. As I stated before I have been with MAA for for over a year not 2 months. This is my second lease after transferring from MAA ******* Ridge to ******. I did not complain or have a problem with this until it affected multiple aspects of my income including my cellular bill and verified that it is optional for MAA to remove our individual unit with less communication then they are doing right now with spectrum.
I will email the Spectrum rep and the ** in the emails provided and continue to wait for a call to be setup. However I will not stop at this resolution it is not resolved until I am no longer paying 2 bills for the same thing.

The application process and agreement itself stated the processing fee of $200 would not be charged until they were ready to actually do the checks. However, the $200 was immediately charged to my account. Not only that, I was immediately given a runaround on my proof of income. I ended up canceling the application, as they clearly did not want me as a tenant. Canceled application well under 48-hour limit and refuse to return the $200 processing fee (I am fine with the sacrifice of the $50 application fee and chalk that up to a bad choice).",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/germantown/profile/property-management/maa-0543-31000112

All of sudden ******** and **** came down from the third floor yelling at me from across the parking lot about me taking a picture of their private property.

Problems with Product/Service,1590526324,Resolved,02/25/2023,Initial Complaint,"On Feb 22, 2023, my apartment (MAA Uptown Village Apartment ****) flooded with gallons of water that looked to be coming from inside the walls. I went to leasing office to get emergency maintanence. They looked at my water meter and there wasn't any indication of leak coming from inside the apartment. One person from maintenance came with a wet vac. They gave me two floor fans, told me to move it around the apartment and left. Water damage that is not properly dealt with will leave lasting damage and cause mold. It seemed like their plan was to leave the two fans there and call it a day. I emailed requesting they send water damage specialist. The speciliast came the next day on Feb 23, 2022. He took moisture readings, took off baseboards, put up a dehumidifier and 8 floor fans in the living room, kitchen, and laundry room. So on Feb 22 the apartment was uninhabitable because of wet floor and water seeping out of flooring, starting Feb 23 it was even more uninhabitable from the noise, dust, and heat generated by the fans. I requested they provide me another apartment. The manager told me ""When an issue like this happens, we fix it and then you will be back in the unit in no time. We did just want to clean it up and put two fans in there to solve the issue, but you wanted a restoration company to come out, so I did what you requested"". On Feb 25, I went back to get some clothes and noticed that the closet smelt very bad. I noticed that the water had seeped through the laundry room and into the closet floor. The carpet, padding, and the floor was wet and had been wet for 4 days. The restoration specialist did not check the closet. The property managers haven't even bothered looking at the apartment. The water damage incident response has been incredibly incompetent considering on Feb 25, there is a wet room that hasn't even been looked at and is still wet.

The rent was $1,900/month, however I opted for a 4 month lease because I knew I had to move end of the year. This added additional $400+ to my rent totally $2300+/month which I paid on time. On Nov 8th, I got an email to renew my lease on a monthly basis (with an increase) from January 2023 to which I replied my lease expires end of the year (Jan 1st).When I went to settle my outstanding bill, the assistant manager ***** said I would be charged a late notice fee of $536 because I should have notified them I wouldn't be renewing by Nov 2nd. I told her that makes no sense, no one told me this. The whole point of signing a 4 month lease is because I planned to leave in 4 months and I was already paying an additional price of $400/month for that choice and even leaving 2 weeks early. After making my case, she removed that fee from my bill and agreed to waive it. When it was removed, I paid all the outstanding.Then all of a sudden after I had moved out, I got a mail with this fee re-appearing with some other charges. I reminded her of the discussion we had, and she said she has no power to waive the bill and I had to pay a late notice fee. This was a bill she had removed initially.I want the assistant manager to stand by her initial agreement.

Complaint: 18728867

I am rejecting this response because:
1. It is not true that they are charging me due to me not fulfilling my financial obligations. I have received 4 different ""final bills"" from this company.
a)One came early December which I paid. I also went front desk to confirm if that was all required and I was told yes - a copy was also printed out for me to show all obligations was fulfilled.
b) a week or more later I got another prompt which was outrageously high, I went back to the front desk, and spoke to one of the managers and she explained even though, I leave early I need to pay for the whole month, and also there was a late termination fee (this was first time I would hear about this}, which was why the outstanding bill was high. After a lengthy discussion with her, the termination fee was removed and I was able to make my outstanding payments. The payment is a lumpsum - you can't pay in parts - she had to remove it for me to had been able to make progress on the payment portal. After this I even paid for the apartment to be cleaned out - just to ensure I wouldn't be accused of not fulfilling my financial obligation. This was a 3rd payment now, all in December before I moved out on the 20th.
c) To my surprise I received a 3rd bill early January (app ~$50) - that I was owing on water bills because the company did not charge me for first 45 days of my stay. By that time i was having challenges logging on to the portal and I told them I would settle the payment when I come back into town early February. 
d) Again to my surprise I got a 4th bill, a week after, this included some other fees and the Jan bills ( till 7th of Jan), and on top of that the ""infamous termination fee"" was brought back. To which I asked ***** that she or another lady manager (adjacent to her office) already removed this fee in December before I paid.
My petition is for MAA to not bring back this termination fee that was waived and stop sending me different bills every week.  I did everything to clear my financial obligations before leaving and I did not receive the letter dropped by the door. I did not drop the keys off on Jan 1st as claimed but on dec 21st and I signed it out with *************

Complaint: 18728867

I am rejecting this response because:
1. I paid the balance because I do not want my credit to be hit, not because I agreed with the business.
2. I did go into the office and I gave them my feedback. I told them to send an automated email warning to the tenants before the due date not after. The way they go about it is exploitative, to which they agreed to take the feedback.
3. It was wrong of MAA to claim I didn't fulfil my financial obligations was the reason for the billing, it was wrong of them to imply I vacated Jan 1st when indeed I dropped the keys, filled their forms and vacated Dec 20th. It was wrong for them to charge me for insufficient notice and then add extra 7 days to my lease and charge me for those again (not sure why)?
I paid off the monies because I think my time will be better spent. MAA should do the ethical thing and refund me, but if they choose not to do so, then I still don't agree with their stance and reject their response and will like that to be noted here.

Problems with Product/Service,1590526388,Answered,12/03/2022,Initial Complaint,"Ive rented at other MAA properties for 8 years with no problems. It has been 5 months at MAA Preserve and the noise complaints have been poorly handled. MAA is a pet friendly community but they should not interfere with a tenants covenant of quiet enjoyment. The person in 201 has a large dog that runs, jumps off furniture, throws things on the floor as early as 5:30am. The chaos is so loud that I have clear recordings on my phone that I presented to the property manager and legal counsel. From 8am to 8pm it is caged where it paws at the floor from boredom, bark all day. I have complained about this to the office with no response. It wasnt until after a ****** review that I was connected with the property manager. While he has been prompt, the solutions to this issue are unsatisfactory. Nothing has changed, so for my mental health I HAVE to take the offer to transfer on my own dime just to be able to sleep and enjoy a living room that I pay $1700 for. The waived fees mean nothing, especially when Im not the one who created the problem. There is a disconnect between the office and property manager. I called to start this process and they have no idea what Im referring to. Its now been a week since then. If I have to move, I need reassurance that I will be approved for the new apt of my choosing so I can repack my life and book a moving company in advance but no.

I can now hear and feel the vibration of every footstep taken by my new neighbors. The vibrations from their footsteps are so strong that they often cause my apartment to shake. My ceiling fans, blinds, and paintings shake. It is intolerable! These noises and vibrations often happen late at night and early in the morning (11 pm - 3 am). As a resident, I am entitled to Quiet Enjoyment. I have the right to occupy my rental unit peacefully. However, I am constantly being disrupted by the noises and vibrations from the upstairs unit. I am also awakened at odd hours of the night by these excessive noises from my upstairs neighbors. These noises include loud banging, dropping, dragging, arguing, yelling, and dogs barking. I have done my due diligence in reporting this issue. I started reaching out to the leasing office for help in July 2022. My next door neighbor and I met with the assistant manager and gave a detailed account of this noise issue. I have sent 7 complaints in writing to the leasing office manager and assistant manager since July 2022.

I explained that the Courtesy Officer was able to respond to her noise complaint against her neighbor within a few minutes and did not hear any noise.  The neighbor is also denying that they are making noise. They did admit to watching a movie and I made them aware they must keep the volume lower as the yelling she heard could have been from the movie.  The neighbor stated she banged on her ceiling (their floor) yelling profanities that same night.  She is denying that she did this. 
I explained that since her neighbor has been disputing being loud with the noise complaints she has placed, we need a witness to the noise as we can't take sides.  She believes that since she has lived here for 7 years that should be enough evidence.  I explained we can't operate that way.  In response to her request of being let out of her lease,I made her aware that MAA can't waive termination fees but that we could waive a transfer fee if she would like to move on-site at her own expense.  She said she would like to move forward with this option. She has selected another apartment to transfer into on-site.

Problems with Product/Service,1590526386,Answered,12/13/2022,Customer response," 
Complaint: 18467290

I am rejecting this response because:
As previously mentioned, I have lived in my unit at MAA ********* for almost seven years without any issues with noise from my neighbors. The manager (******************************) has given no appreciation for the fact that I have been a resident for seven years with no prior complaints. However, the current tenants above me have been making excessive and abnormally loud noises, often late at night and early in the morning. I have recorded these noises for verification. However, the manager has refused to accept them.
Also, as previously stated, after the renovations to the flooring, I can now hear and feel the vibration of every footstep taken by the tenants and their dogs.
After my last complaint, the MAA Riverside manager offered to transfer me to another unit. I spent a significant amount of time and effort searching and viewing new units. We were not able to find another 2nd-floor unit that would not have a noise issue. Therefore, I was considering transferring to a third-floor unit. However, I do not wish to live on the third floor.
In addition, the manager's response (BBB response) belittled my complaint. She stated that the yelling I heard might have been from the upstairs neighbors watching a movie on t.v. She has no evidence of this and should not have stated it. She failed to mention in her response that my upstairs neighbors admitted to watching a movie loudly at 3:00 am. She stated that she asked them to lower the volume. She also failed to mention that the courtesy officer went to the unit to investigate the noise issue. However, the neighbors did not answer their door. In fact, the courtesy officer stated that each time he visited the upstairs unit in response to a noise complaint, the tenants never answered their door, and he informed the manager of this.
Further, ****'s response quoted a statement from the upstairs tenants (indicating that I banged on the ceiling and yelled profanities). This was a blatant lie. She had no evidence of this and no right to quote this. This was very unprofessional. More importantly, this is defamation. It goes against MAA's commitment to providing its residents with a safe, fair, and comfortable living environment. Her response is unacceptable. The handling of this situation is unacceptable.
As previously stated, I can no longer have peaceful enjoyment in my unit. Furthermore, I was unable to find a suitable replacement unit. Therefore, I request to be let out of my lease. I also made this request to the corporate office. They did not respond to my request. The manager responded. She overlooked my previous response, where I stated that I do not wish to live on the 3rd floor.
I request to be let out of my lease. As I have the legal right to enjoy my unit peacefully, this should be a straightforward request. However, it has currently been denied.

It was time for me to move and I emailed them to find a remedy for me due to my health condition.

After blatantly ignoring my emails, I was finally able to get someone on the phone (which is impossible most times), who said the elevator was not owned by them so they couldnt do anything.

Therefore, I spent more than $300 on movers, a Uhaul truck, etc. MAA has failed to take any responsibility for their inadequacies and inability to provide a decent standard of living.

Complaint: 17783223

I am rejecting this response because:
1. If the officer you have hired is consistently unavailable, you at least need to have a protocol for how to handle issues that arise in the meantime. ******** calls and neglecting to follow up is not an appropriate response. 
2. The lock on the mailbox was only disengaged AFTER a complaint was made to the city and the complex received a code violation. Management only complied with this request because a state agency forced them to. It should not be so difficult to convince management to do what they are legally obligated to do.
As far as I am aware, the lock has not been replaced or repairedsimply disengaged. We live in *****; humidity is not an acceptable excuse for neglecting to replace malfunctioning equipment. I suggest investing in a lock that is not effected by the humidity. 
3. This cant possibly be true. There is a lack of required signageas mandated by the stateto legally enforce towing. There is no information posted on the property about the towing company used or how to contact them, and the accessible spots do not state that towing is enforced.
Either you are flat-out lying, or you are illegally towing vehicles. Regardlessthe appropriate signage needs to be installed and towing needs to be enforced.

The most noticeable, in 4 different spots, is in front of the couch, walking into the living room, walking into the main bedroom, and walking into the secondary bedroom all the way to the bathroom.  The normal wear down of this carpet is 5 years.  Since it has only been two since it was last replaced this is considered above normal wear and tear.  Wear patterns do not come out with cleaning and because of the number of places that have been worn, it was decided to replace the carpet.

We charged the resident based on the lease agreement using the invoice we received when the carpet was replaced in 2020 prior to moving in.

I am rejecting this response because:
your claim of your carpet lasting 5 years is not credible, if youll notice in the invoice from 2020 and the most current invoice the square footage is exactly the same.  Replacing the carpet and passing the cost onto the renter every time someone moves out is not a business run with integrity. I suggest you escalate the issue as there are multiple complaints of the same practice on BBB.

Problems with Product/Service,1590526370,Answered,08/19/2022,Initial Complaint,Post Eastside Apartments have charged me with carpet replacement. A pre-insepction was completed in which no issues were found. At the time of the pre-inspection I was moved out and carpets were cleaned with a provided invoice in which no stains were found. The apartment complex has sent a few photos in which stains are seen on the bottom in which the top of carpet and the bottom carpet pad do not match these stains. These so stains look to be seen on carpet bottom only and look to be nothing and I believe these to be existing. The so stains seen at the bottom of the carpet which I believe were there before I moved in. ************************* assistance property manager was the one that was part of the pre inspection and stated they found nothing at that time. Then later I have a move out statement charging me $594.19 . ****** is stating that these stains alone are what causing carpet to be replaced. Please note that in the lease section **** provides me a visual and odor inspection not a inspection of the bottom of the carpet to see any existing stains as these. ************************* knew that I did not and no renter is able to see the bottom of their carpets before moving in yet told me to go pull up the carpets. Not only is this not acceptable it is rude and condescending to ask a tenant to pull up his own carpet knowing that he had not seen the condition on the bottom of the carpet. I find that these stains were not created by me and were produced to create a way to replace carpets on the previous tenants dime. I have video evidence that the carpet was stain free from the top when I completed the pre-inspection and moved out. I am seeing that Post Eastside refund me my complete amount of $594.19 and any involved fees and time I have spent.

The recommendation was for replacement due to pet damage.  We then use a separate company for the replacement of the carpet.  We charge the resident based on the life expectancy of the carpet which is 5 years.  They receive credit for the age of the carpet and are charged a pro-rated amount of the carpet replacement.

As to a inspection completed at the bottom of the carpet it is not valid as it was not inspected by me before move in or allowed. So I decline to inspect the previously unknown condition of the carpet underneath after I move out. Please note you are stating that there was visible stains on top of the carpet yet that was not captured on your pre-inspection and was not listed on your first invoice along with the carpet cleaning company I used. Furthermore we are now stating pet damage from no pets that were in the apartment or on the lease. Please explain how that happens or is possible?  As well your provided invoice stating staining is on padding needs be replaced and was not that the carpet  needing replacement. Also see from the pictures the pad looks to be unstained and not matching this description. This contradicts your next invoice replacing the carpet.

I spoke to the property manager, ***************************, about the unfulfilled maintenance requests. She became very rude: she continually interrupted me (by blaming her coworkers), raised her voice, and spoke to me in a demeaning manner. When I requested that she speak to me respectfully, she accused me of being aggressive, and shouted that I get out of here! This behavior took me by surprise, so I questioned her tone and volume. She then walked away from me to retrieve her phone and called 9-1-1. When speaking to the 9-1-1 operator, she gave my description and said that I was intimidating her and being aggressive. While still on the phone, she walked towards me stopping about 2 inches from my face (she was as close as a lover coming in for a kiss). This was a gross violation of my personal space and an intimidation tactic. I asked her several times to back up and she ignored my request. She then walked around me, opened the main office door, and yelled for me to get out. I obliged, while exiting the door, she pushed it closed and the door hit me in the right arm and leg. This is not the first time that the property manager has shown flagrant negligence and prejudice towards me. In April 2022, she accused me of violating my lease and threatened to call the police when I went to inquire about the nature of the lease violation. Following the August 2 incident, I received a letter from the leasing office on August 3, 2022. In this letter she falsely accused me of using abusive language, intimidation, and aggression. The letter stated that I was to vacate the property by 5pm on August 4, 2022.There was no investigation of the accusations, only a conclusion of eviction that does not reflect NC eviction laws.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/germantown/profile/property-management/maa-0543-31000112

Based upon the stains and wear on the carpet, the management team and our carpet vendor partner determined that a replacement was warranted.  Please note that we have no obligation to clean carpet prior to a replacement when the carpet condition obviously indicates a replacement is necessary.  In this instance, based upon inspection there was no indication that a cleaning would have removed the stains fully and the wear on the carpet would not have been resolved by a carpet cleaning.  
 While a carpet cleaning may have been offered at the time of renewal or during the move-out process, the expense of cleaning a carpet that cannot be salvaged would not be incurred.  Please note that normal wear and tear is assumed however the photos indicate more wear than is reasonable for the age of the carpet.  The carpet charges were appropriately depreciated based upon the age of the carpet.

Complaint: 17616628

I am rejecting this response because: Lease documents indicate a 60 day notice only is required for move out prior to the end of the lease. In addition, I moved in on the 4th. 1 calendar year is the 4th, not the 8th. I moved out prior to the 4th. This dispute is over the days from the 4th to the 8th when notice was given of vacating 60 days prior. I have not received an email, my first phone call was after 10 pm at night the same day I filed the complaint. My last call and the only call that has a voicemail is from a few days ago during my working hours.

Sec **** which outlines that with few exceptions, you are required to remain rent responsible through the end of your lease.
 Alternative to remaining rent responsible, the options to vacate the lease earlier without remaining rent-responsible would be outlined in section 4 of the lease agreement which include providing the 60-day notice, repaying the move in concessions which you received at move in and paying an early termination fee of 1.5 times the rent. As all of this seems punitive over physically vacating a few days prior to the end of the lease, we elected to simply charge the minimal amount of prorated rent for a few days. This is also in line with the date on the notice to vacate which you signed on 2/8/22. The additional fees would have added up to approximately $2930 due versus the charged amount of prorated rent of only $285.87.

My moveout date was on 6/14/22, on this date the moving company I hired (Trinity relocation group) - Topnotch Movers came to pick up my belongings. The loading dock elevator has been broken for 2-3 weeks and some of my furniture would not fit in the regular elevators, for this reason the moving company had to bring down my sofa through the stairs at an additional cost of 525 dollars. I tried to talk to the community manager but she was not available and they stated she was only reachable by email. I reached out to MAA corporate to talk to someone about potentially having them cover the additional expense due to the elevator being broken. They stated that I should use the stairs, I responded back with the fact that it meant a surcharge. They then proceeded to respond that it was my responsibility/problem as I was the one who signed the contract with the movers and proceed to express that companies move things while using stairs free of charge and it was solely my responsibility as I had signed the contract. I requested to speak to someone else and another phone call followed another employee at MAA corporate who stated she was calling me to emphasize that they would not cover any additional expense and that I should not expect anything else from the company. The other solution suggested by the community staff was just to leave my sofa in the apartment and that their own staff would move it out to get rid of it, however, why should I part with my belongings out of the fact that the building facilities are not operational to serve my needs. Another matter that occurred as well is that I missed to notify them exactly on the 60 day **** about my intention to move out, missed by 14 days. They proceeded to extend my contract by 14 days and charge me month to month rate on rental for said 14 days, which increased my rent expenses significantly.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/germantown/profile/property-management/maa-0543-31000112

Thank you for providing us with an additional opportunity to review your move out from ******************, specifically the additional charges you faced through your moving company due to the service elevator being down.


Unfortunately, the elevator was waiting on a new door. To note, when things malfunction at a community we work as quickly as possible to get them repaired. At times, the necessary repairs are delayed due to external factors. In this case, the shipping of the door was delayed due to supply chain issues which is something that we were not able to control.


I am sorry that your moving company did have to charge you more for using the stairs, however, we will not be providing any compensation to you regarding this matter.


Regarding your concern with your notice, it is outlined in your lease agreement that we required a 60-day notice. Should you not provide a 60-day notice, you are extended to fulfill the 60-day requirement and additional days that are incurred past your original lease end date are billed at the month-to-month rate.

 Dear ****************,
 Despite my efforts to resolve this matter with your property manager, *********************, and your Regional Vice ********** ****************************** as the latter does not seem to comprehend the magnitude of the event that occurred at our apartment in May, I wish to discuss this further with you or ***************************** superior. I have outlined a brief timeline below and attached photographs showing the condition of our home throughout the event. I provided ******* with a link to view the same pictures. However, I can tell who viewed the files, and she did not. I am spending way too much time on this and hope to get to the bottom of it soon.
 Our apartment has flooded twice since we took tenancy. In May, due to the failure of the air conditioner condensate overflow switch, our apartment suffered critical water damage. 100% of the wooden floors and our work office carpet had to be removed and replaced. There was so much water under the floorboards that the maintenance men used towels to absorb it, ring them out in the sink, and then use them again. Again, this was the second time our apartment flooded since we took occupancy on February 17, 2021. None of these events resulted from negligent acts of your tenants, us. However, your property manager told us we had to make whatever arrangements to continue our lives and referred us to renters insurance because thats what they are for. I have not heard back from her since.
 The wet carpet was partially pulled back, and dryer fans were placed throughout the apartment to dry the concrete. We were not asked to leave; maintenance went for it, leaving our unit blowing dust and mold particles for hours, days. We had to relocate to a nearby hotel and set up a temporary workstation to continue working from May 9th to May 19th. We needed an air quality check to ensure the air was safe in the apartment. It was not. A copy of the mold inspection and lab report is attached. I called your Property Manager, who was abrupt and attempted to cut me off at every opportunity. I asked her to keep the conversation on a professional level and requested to let me talk. I told her about our air quality check, and she said, we will not pay for that. I told her its not a matter of who pays but what needs to be done to ensure the apartment is not in an unlivable condition.
 I do not want to hear from *** or **** *** again; as you can imagine, we are going in circles dealing with them. I request this matter to be escalated accordingly. *** is rude, loud-spoken, and unpleasant to deal with. I didnt want to escalate to her regional; I had no choice. I will not let *** cut me off and be loud at me. She added unnecessary stress to an already stressful situation. **** *** is unapologetic and lacks attention to detail (she completed bypassed several items mentioned in my email and didnt even look at the files I shared with her.  I am not dealing with either one of them anymore. **** Lous attempt to resolve the problem was poorly handled. She didnt even address all the bullet points in my email. It took time to document everything, file the insurance claim, write letters to MAA and **** ***, and she didnt look at the pictures I shared? Im not dealing with her anymore. They are not taking time to assist us, so Im hoping someone higher up will.
 The carpet in the West-facing bedroom was replaced on May 18th. The floors throughout the apartment were replaced on May 19th. Final remediation for the damage was completed on May 28th. We have yet to have time to put our apartment back into the condition it was before the water damage. We are still doing that as of today. We cant do everything in a day or two. Its taking much time to put the apartment together as it was; none of us need that.
Additionally, I dont need a rude and unprofessional property manager and a regional manager who doesnt spend the proper amount of time reading my emails or viewing the attachments. I pointed out twice that we have not received an apology yet still havent received an apology. I expected **** *** to at least start with the right foot; Im very unimpressed.
 This event resulted in the need for temporary accommodation, unforeseen expenses (take out, room service, safety signs, ruined furniture), and caused critical work interruptions, which affected three of four classes my employer paid for me ($600, I mentioned this to **** ***, she said nothing about it). I had to somehow figure things out without help from MAA Midtown. I had to find a place to live, couldnt use our kitchen, had to order take-out numerous times and again, pay out of my pocket, and hoped renters insurance would reimburse me. No, follow-*** from ***, none. I had to discontinue talking to her because she was rude and unprofessional. If she cant show compassion, sympathy, or be willing to assist in such a situation, what can she do, or what is she suitable for? You should hire someone that knows when to say, Im sorry, and I apologize for the inconvenience. You put a man recovering from knee surgery and his caregiver under tremendous stress. *** barely walked without a ******, and he had to go live and work elsewhere because his home office was flooded. I had to help him relocate temporarily, and I had to work in the bedroom. It was impossible to work with blowers on, repairs happening, and people walking in and out impossible. How about someone starts realizing the magnitude of this issue?
 We are not being treated with the respect we deserve, and MAA hasnt done much to resolve this issue. Again, please escalate this matter and do not send *** or **** *** my way; I gave them a chance, and they blew it. Im moving on.
 The following is a breakdown of why we are asking for $5,194.26 previously shared and ignored by **** ***:
 Rent abatement for May - $3,145.00 (she offered a seven-day credit, thats insulting and unacceptable)
Furniture damaged due to water damage - $100.00 (I shared pictures, and she ignored them and ignored this item)
Caution Wet Floor signs - $60.00 (Also shared images, and she ignored them and ignored this item)
Air Quality Check - $350.00 (I attached a copy of the report, which shows the presence of toxic mold and the total cost. **** *** ignored this item)
Excess of our insurance policy limit for temporary relocation - $1,089.26 (I shared a copy of the renters insurance claim, the total amount paid, and the total amount unpaid. **** *** ignored this item)
Interrupted webinar required by my employer - $450.00 (My employer paid $600; I missed the majority of the first three classes. **** *** ignored this item)

Note: Receipts are available upon request.
 I did hope your property manager would resolve this matter. Still, she told me nothing would happen from inception, discouraged me from claiming for the cost of the air quality check, and encouraged me to make a complaint that she would forward to her regional manager instead. I did hope your Regional Vice President would handle this situation with care, apologize, and start fresh. Instead, your Regional Vice President was unapologetic and didnt even look at the bulleted. items in the email (or maybe she did and chose to ignore them which is very rude), and belittling the magnitude of the situation by stating I understand you were disappointed and the below resolution in no way declares wrongdoing on our service teams and we worked diligently. See below:
 I understand you were disappointed with the experience, although leaks/maintenance concerns can happen and we are committed to making things right. We worked diligently to complete the repairs although we did experience a delay in supplies. Once supplies were received our service team completed the repairs same day. At this time, I will be able to offer you the following as a resolution to your concerns. The below resolution in no way declares wrongdoing on our service teams behalf, although this attempt is to provide you with the best possible customer service as you did experience a leak in the home.
 How does the below resolve this issue? See my comments in red below in response to **** Lous attempt to resolve the issue. Therefore Im not dealing with her anymore:
 I understand you were disappointed with the experience, (No **** ***, you dont understand.) although leaks/maintenance concerns can happen and we are committed to making things right. (I requested daily follow-*** and received none What commitment? We worked diligently to complete the repairs although we did experience a delay in supplies.(It didnt show, at all, we were in the dark, no updates from your property manager. We received information (from ****, the Maintenance guy) with such little notice, it was ridiculous. **** is the only person that attempted to help somehow even though he is not our property manager. Kudos to **** for his efforts. Once supplies were received our service team completed the repairs same day. (Yes, but you promised they would be done timely. I didnt want to have to. Relocate my recently operated husband. It took a month and over 7 thousand dollars out of our pockets later. You dont understand the level of stress you put us through) At this time, I will be able to offer you the following as a resolution to your concerns. (You only addressed one bullet point, I suggest you read my email again) The below resolution in no way declares wrongdoing on our service teams behalf, although this attempt is to provide you with the best possible customer service as you did experience a leak in the home. (The best possible customer service starts with an apology, which I never received. I dont need nor appreciate you being defensive, I would prefer a different tone and a more helpful approach Also, having to relocate because the entire apartment flooded, 100% of the wooden floor and one carpeted room had to be replaced, and not being able to live in our home for a whole month, is a lot more than a leak.
 **** Lous response aggravated the issue. I will not go away until this issue is resolved. I wasnt this unhappy, but now I am very unhappy. Do better, MAAC.

You leased with ** on May 26, 2022 and committed to apartment 720 at the rate of $1995. I understand you later inquired about transferring your application to apartment home 711.

As the Property Manager, **'************** has communicated with you this price was in fact an error. This home is still available and the correct rate is $2135 if you'd like to select this home instead.

Problems with Product/Service,1590526338,Answered,05/24/2022,Initial Complaint,I entered a lease agreement in September 2021 with **************************. I had issues with a sister property and decided to transfer to this one because is claims to be a luxury apartment. I worked with the assistant property manager and asked all questions I had before signing a lease agreement with them. The biggest question being if I had to terminate early what was the protocol. I was told a 30 day notice is all that was required. I filled out the walk through form and none of my requests were fixed. New management has since then taken over. I am experiencing issues with mice due to a hole being behind the stove and hot water heater room which I had no knowledge about. It was patched and I still have mice. I have mold in everyone of my window ***** growing actively because of moisture. The windows are bad. The window company claimed to have cut new glass but when I took a day off of work for the install no one showed up. Management tries to blame the tenant for their mishaps. I am done with broken promises and incompetent maintenance staff and I am disgusted with this property. It is no need to transfer to another dump within this complex as I am over it with MAA properties. I am now told to terminate my lease its a 60 day notice and 4 times the monthly rent is due. I sat with previous management and discussed all terms and conditions of this lease at signing. I no longer want to stay at this property. They are liars and are all about them and not the tenant. Mice moisture and mold is what I am dealing with everyday. MAJOR health concern.,https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/germantown/profile/property-management/maa-0543-31000112

I am a prospective tenant for apartment number - 104B8310 at MAA managed ****************** located in *************, ******, **. Since yesterday, I've raised the understated concern to the customer care number available on their website and property management and haven't got a solution yet. The journey started a couple of weeks back (around April 19, 2022) when I got interested in leasing with them. Although, leasing with them was not at all easy, we managed to get at a good place and a holding fee of $250 was deducted from my bank account which is not supposed to be refundable after 48 hours if the tenant backs off from signing the lease for ""whatever"" reason. First of all, this policy was not communicated to me when the amount was deducted even until yesterday (May 03) when I enquired about the refund process I didn't get my lease yet since April 23. I had a deadline as my co-applicant was who was nominally arranged to get my application for mere verification at the suggestion of one of the leasing agents, is traveling to some remote regions for work purposes and is incapacitated to sign the lease. This information was provided to the leasing agent from day one, and he has been given regular reminders (almost every day) about the deadline. Irrespective of this mental suffering, I was very patient and was waiting for the lease, but it turned out that one of the leasing agents didn't want to address my situation in absence of the agent I was leasing with. I have been mis-treated by him over the call and straight-away denied my refund in such exceptional circumstances. I have been treated very disrespectfully and that gave me a lot of stress. I have been again denied the refund over a call by the higher authority and I am helpless.

Problems with Product/Service,1590526351,Answered,12/30/2021,Initial Complaint,"My lease ended on Dec 8th 2021. I wasn't required to provide a security deposit at time of move in. Once I move out of the apartment on Dec 7th I had cleaned the apartment throughly. I took pictures of the entire apartment on Dec 7th. My lease was for 14 months. I never was late with any payments and left the property in great condition considering a 14 month stay of normal wear and tear. I have reviewed all laws associated with my lease agreement. The Department of Agriculture Trade and Consumer Protection states in ATCP 134.06, that a landlord cannot charge you for cleaning if it is normal wear and tear. I was sent a bill for 234 dollars for carpet cleaning, replacing a light bulb, replacing the stove pans and general cleaning of the apartment. In fulfilling my lease, 14 months of normal wear and tear, no late payments or any complaints against me, having verified pictures of the unit at time of move in and move out, I firmly believe that this apartment is attempting to bully people with threats not warranted. I have received a threatening email stating that the 234 dollars would be sent to collections. This apartment wanted me to renew my lease. I declined because they wanted to increase my rent by at least 400 dollars a month with a 12 month lease. This so called market value is highway robbery. This complex is abusing and threatening its tenants not only myself, and definitely needs to be investigated.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/germantown/profile/property-management/maa-0543-31000112

MAA charged me an increase of 18.37% increase for a 12 month lease. I explained this was extremely high and asked to have it reduced. The property manager told me this is market value and the answer was no. She went on to explain that I actually had a savings of $123 because my rent increase was not at the rent they are currently charging for at 650 square foot apartment. I also stated there were no improvements to this property that warranted such a high increase. They replaced cardio machines, the light outside the door and new wood on the doors to the trash area. I don't consider this improvements, but maintenance upkeep. I decided to reach out to the Regional Manager and she gave me the same answer as the property manager.

Billing/Collection Issues,1590526347,Answered,11/13/2021,Initial Complaint,"I lived at *** **************** property in unit ****. Upon moving in, soon after within the first month, my hot water heater broke and flooded the apartment. I called immediately for someone to come out and fix the problem. My carpet remained wet for 2 weeks after this happened because all they did was put a fan in the apartment that I left on at all hours. Ever since then I have been noticing mold, it took over my apartment covering organic things first, like boxes and clothes, then it started covering electronics and kitchen supplies, and my walls as well as visible black goop in my air vents. My dog and I became very sick, and kept getting sicker. She licked the mold off the wall and got really sick one day and I thought she was going to die. I have spent so much money on cleaning the ""mildew"" as the complex calls it, and also replacing things I throw out (the cycle continued three times-throw my stuff out and replace it). Since there was nothing done about the issue I took the matter to corporate office, and asked for their help. They ""sent a maintenance man out for an emergency request"" he called me and said he was on his way but never came. After that I left with my dog and only two outfits I pulled straight from the wash. I then called renters insurance and they couldn't do anything. Four or so days later I came back to the apartment and a maintenance man and I were going to walk into the apartment at the same time. He said ""oh sh-t this is really bad I need to leave and go tell my boss about this"", I've heard nothing since. I proceeded to get the mold tested and found out it's toxic black mold that could leave me with life long health effects. Since then I have been looking for a lawyer but cannot afford a retainer since I worked from home-I lost my job-especially due to the fact mold was growing on my actual computer I worked from. I've been calling corporate office everyday asking for help, and I've gotten nothing.

Four days later the equipment to dry out the carpet/apartment was removed. In October the resident contacted the office about a discoloration on the walls in her apartment. Maintenance responded and found no source to create mold on behalf of MAA. No plumbing or water leaks were found in the apartment. Mainteance did find that the resident had no ventilation in her apartment and the resident has a couple of large 55+ gallon fish tanks. The resident was informed that both of these were the contributing factors to the enviroment in her apartment. Housekeeping issues were also noted and contributed to the enviroment in the apartment. Maintenance, management and corporate all communicated with and responded to the resident.Resident was informed to run her ac/heat to allow ventilation in her apartment.

I have reviewed the lease contract and included the information on early termination below. As you will note, the terms of the lease do require a written 60 day notice of intent to termination the lease plus and an early termination fee equal to two time the monthly rent. These are the standard terms of our lease contract and are unable to be modified. While the lease does state that payment of the early termination fee is due at the time of giving notice, we are happy to offer a payment plan for up to 90 days after move-out. This can be arranged by contacting the leasing office. I will be following up with Ms. **** today regarding her customer service inquiry and will share this information with her. RESIDENT'S OPTION FOR EARLY LEASE TERMINATION 4.1 Early Lease Termination Option (""Early Termination Option""): You may terminate this Lease before the expiration of the initial term if You are not in default under this Lease at the time of giving written notice or thereafter, and if You strictly comply with all of the provisions of this paragraph: 4.1.1 In order to terminate this Lease pursuant to this paragraph before the expiration of the initial term, You must: 4.1.1.1 Give Landlord sixty 60 days' written notice or pay an additional termination fee equal to rent for the period equal to sixty 60 days less the actual number of days' notice you provided (""Additional Termination Fee"") (e.g., if you only give fifteen 15 days' notice you will pay your standard rent for fifteen 15 days plus an additional termination fee equal to rent for forty-five (45) days) at the time of giving notice; PLUS 4.1.1.2 Pay all monies due through date of termination, including, but not limited to, the payment of prorated rent; PLUS 4.1.1.3 Pay a fee in an amount equal to the sum of two times Your Monthly Base Rent (""Early Termination Fee"") at the time of giving notice. Consumer Response /* (3000, 7, 2021/10/26) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) While I appreciate the response. My complaint clearly was not read properly on either end. I don't have the money to be set up on a payment plan. That was my reason for asking for it to be waived, because I just don't have the funds. Surely you all make millions of dollars a year. And waiving 3 grand will not hurt. I really need the help as I stated I have a toddler and another baby on the way. If you can help out by waiving the fees that would be great. Business Response /* (4000, 9, 2021/10/28) */ We understand and regret that Ms. **** is dissatisfied with the terms of the lease. Unfortunately, we are unable to modify the contract. The requirements for early termination are standard at all MAA communities and failure to adhere to the requirements consistently would result in non-compliance with Federal Fair Housing guidelines. If Ms. **** is not able to take advantage of the payment plan previously mentioned, the balance would be placed with a collection agency 30 days after move-out. This is also standard practice at MAA communities. If this occurs, I'm sure NCS will work with Ms. **** to establish a longer payment plan.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/germantown/profile/property-management/maa-0543-31000112

I wanted to share the following with you to assure that I am addressing your concerns. Concerning your rental payment from Catholic Charities, I have received their confirmation that this check was sent on 8/18 and due to the known issue of mail delivery being a bit slow recently in this area, with this documentation, I will waive the late fee if it arrives after the due date. This will allow time for another check to be issued if this one is lost. I do understand your concerns with your neighbors and I can assure you that I will be active here and all remedies allowed to correct any behavior that is not in accordance with the lease will be addressed. Regarding your concern about our process when confirming assistance animals, I have asked our attorney to review and wanted to share the following information that supports our process. Under Fair Housing laws and guidance issued by both the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a person requesting an accommodation must demonstrate the need for the requested accommodation (assistance animal accommodation or modification). To establish need, the disabled individual must demonstrate that the requested accommodation, if granted, would ameliorate the alleged limitation the disabled individual encounters in the use or enjoyment of his or her apartment. In layman's terms, the requested accommodation must be necessary to lessen the impact of the disability. HUD permits housing providers to request ""reliable documentation of a disability"" and of the ""disability-related need for an assistance animal"" when the existence of a disability and disability-related need are not readily apparent or known to the housing provider. FHEO-201301, dated April 25, 2013. The documentation must be from a ""reliable source"". A ""reliable"" source is defined in HUD/DOJ Joint Statement on ""Reasonable Accommodations Under the Fair Housing Act"" issued on May 17, 2004, and further discussed in the HUD Guidance issued on January 28, 2020. A reliable source must ""be in a position to know"" (DOJ/HUD Joint Statement at 13-14) - i.e., must have ""personal knowledge"" (HUD Guidance January 28, 2020) of the existence of the disability and disability-related need. The above clearly supports that a housing provider is entitled to request reliable documentation of the existence of a disability and that an assistance animal is necessary to ameliorate symptoms of the disability so as to allow the person an equal opportunity to use and enjoy his or her apartment. Housing providers are allowed to evaluate the documentation provided to determine whether it is reliable. DOJ and HUD guidance documents assist housing providers in making this determination. Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can further assist in any way.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/germantown/profile/property-management/maa-0543-31000112

Upon entering my apartment, I notice a generous amount of water in my hallway. After walking through the hallway, I notice a cluster of ants in the crack of the baseboard and crawling up the wall. While walking towards my kitchen area, the carpet was soaked with water. Upon entering the kitchen, water was coming from beneath the cabinet next to the sink. I put my towels down on the floor so the water would not enter the apartment next to me. I then went to the bathroom to make sure there was not any water in there as well. Once I entered the bathroom, it was ants coming from beneath the baseboard and crawling up the wall. I sprayed the ants with some of the Raid Ant spray I had but more ants were coming out the wall. At approximately 1:52am, I called the Emergency Maintenance line and left a message explaining the incident. I also sent a video I recorded to the leasing manager. At approximately 8:30am, two maintenance men came in and looked around and did not know where the water came from. I then proceeded to inform them of the ants that I had coming out the floor. The maintenance men then notified me that I will have to call the office so they can have someone come out and spray. At approximately 9:17pm, I called the office informing the leasing agent of the ant infestation. She proceeded to tell me that I will have to go out and purchase my own pest control service.

Our community only have two floors so if he hears something above its not another unit. last but no least we do not have a 3hundre pound man in out office, no one in this office disrespects anyone. If whom ever made the complaint placed a work order then it was put in the system according to policy. The person he spoke with did what he or she was to do. If the resident can give a true name then we can move forward with getting true issues resolved. Right now we cant move forward with assisting due to a false name being given......

Problems with Product/Service,1523745403,Answered,12/06/2021,Initial Complaint,"I have called, left voicemails, emailed, as well as show up to the office to rectify the situations at hand. The 1st situation is regarding the portal constantly charging multiple times for the same item each month, resulting in a balance that I do not actually have. Additionally, there was a leak from the upstairs water heater that came to my apartment which led my carpet having to be pulled up and pads pulled out. The guy informed me that he would be back next week but ""next week"" never came. I have made many complaints about the following situations and these are just the most important two. Just before September, the extra balance was just $70.20 but rose to $105.33 (an email was sent on 09.25.21 regarding the following)...the carpet issue was also mentioned in the email. Even though the concern for the carpet was mostly for the smell (which I have gotten rid of over time), there still should not be that much of a gap for something as simple as carpet pads...especially for an individual who pays their rent faithfully. I have been at this apartment about five years and these many problems have never been the issue. If I approached the situation a handful of times, it would seem as though it would have already been rectified, but months and months keep rolling by. It is now December and there is still not action being taken towards what I have been giving them grace on for months because, stuff does happen. BUT they still want the rent on time and the upkeep of the apartment on my part, therefore, I need that same reciprocation. Furthermore, some of the neighbors aren't the cleanliest and that mess trickles down whether I want it to or not. There are standards and rules put into place for the upkeep of the apartments and it is unfair to reap the poor benefits of someone else taking poor care of their apartment area. If people that are over the apartment expect me to continuously pay rent on time, then I should be able to have problems rectified timely as well.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/memphis/profile/apartments/the-boulevard-0543-44157564

So I explained to her that I need to know how much my actual rent is if the online system is saying that my charge is that amount including late fees. She kept saying that late fees weren't applied. But if she told me that the rent is late on the 2nd of each month, (which I have never heard before) that would be contradicting to say that the amount isn't correct.

I just want them to wet vac the water out of it so that it won't start stinking.

Former Tenant of The Park at Paisley Unit: ******************** This complaint is my last attempt to finding some sort of resolve. I have been trying to retrieve the refund of my initial move in deposit from former apartment complex, The Park at Paisley for nearly 3 months. Back in May of 2020, after multiple issues that went unresolved, including my patio flooding due to a collapsed water drain, leaking from ceiling, trash over flowing onto the parking lot near the front entrance of apartments, and a broken security gate, I decided that I would not be renewing my upcoming lease (August 6th). After making this decision, I promptly informed management and provided my ""intent to vacate,"" within the proper timeframe. After management received notice, I was told as long as I vacate my residence by end of lease date (August 6th), pay the prorated lease amount from August 1st to August 6th ($153.00) and pass final apartment walk through inspection, I will be refunded the initial move deposit amount 30 days from end of lease date. My last rental payment of $158.00 (which includes $5.00 trash fee) was paid via money order on August 4th and given to assistant manager, Ms. **** August 6th, 2020, I had my final walkthrough with Ms. *****, a Park at Paisley associate. She informed me that the walkthrough was sufficient, I turned in my keys to the residence, and was told once again that I should receive my initial move in deposit upon final review with management, which would take 30 days from that day. On September 11th, 2020 and September 30th, 2020, after not receiving my deposit or any further correspondence from my former residence, I contacted the office to inquire about the matter. On September 30th, I was asked to email a copy of the original letter of intent to vacate. I emailed the requested information, to the email provided by the associate I spoke with, Ms. ******* (paisley@bmresidential.com). Was advised that she would speak with management and I should expect a call from them shortly. On October 15th, 2020, after waiting but failing to be contacted, I contacted the office one again. I was told by Ms. *******, that my final payment was not received and that my account was listed as negligent. I then provided and emailed proof of final payment that was made timely and proof of initial move in deposit to the email provided (paisley@bmresidential.com). After review of email, Ms. ******* stated that yes, it would have appeared my final payment was made timely and that I would indeed be owed my initial deposit of $791.00. She advised me that her manager was out of the office and she would have her contact me the next day. After waiting 4 days with no contact from the manager, I called the office again on October 23rd, 2020. I was told by an associate, Ms. *****, to send the proof of last payment and deposit to her work email (******@bmresidential,com).Upon receiving email, Ms. ***** informed me that the information I provide would be given to the appropriate management as would be asked to be expedite, since I have now been waiting over 2 months for my deposit to be refunded. Since then, I've waited and tried to contact the office on multiple occasions; October 28th. 2020, November 3rd, 2020, November 4th, 2020, and today, November 5th, 2020.

My water damage was painted over NOT repaired. Lets get things correct. I live here I know what has been fixed and is still not suitable, while they dont even come in and check behind their workers or anything. Half a** work is all thats been done every ticket put in. Still no alarm ticket or knock has been received or recorded but theyve had time to try and file eviction orders while people try to take care of their problems, STOP having to sleep in their car etc. Money is their only motive. And these bedbugs wouldve been a non factor if you also go by your lease contracts and have the proper amount of people in surrounding apartments as well not 7kids and 4 adults above me on flex payments smh. Go by the lease at all times not just when your money is due and maybe these issues wouldnt arise.

We thought if she is doing this now she would definitely do it as a resident. We did inform her that her 300 deposit/admin fee would be returned since we declined the move in. It takes up to 30 days to process, which she was also informed. We also have text communication with her to confirm. Consumer Response /* (3000, 7, 2022/01/18) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) The call was placed to ME with a MOVE IN DATE... not a date to complete paperwork. Please understand the person that placed the call failed ME as a disabled person with LUPUS failed to keep track of the process. On the day the call was made to ME I expressed my discomfort in having to wait until my MOVE IN DATE to complete the process. Of course after sitting many minutes hearing and seeing responsibility being shifted from one department to the other, I have three movers & all of my belongings Awaiting a move. I was told to return the next day but gave them until WED to complete the apartment, but once again I was called & told to return the next day. Upon arrival the next day with my movers the apartment was still NOT FINISHED. I was being mistreated and was attempted to be bullied into treated & spoken to in such a manner & forced into taking a below standard apartment. I showed when I was told CONGRATULATIONS YOUR MOVE IN DATE IS DECEMBER 20. By this time my joints & nerves had begun to fray and the disrespectful manner in which the PROPERTY MANAGER represented was deplorable. The fact that the young lady that placed the call waited 30 minutes to admit SHE PLACED THE INITIAL move in date call was also aggravated the situation. Although I supplied a screenshot of the deposit payment I was still being questioned of why I was there on DEC 20. I have called the corporate number daily since the incident to complain and to check the status of my deposit to NO AVAIL. This was a perfect location for me to get closer to my family not a move of desperation as has been implied in their response. I was mistreated, disrespected & inconvenienced & treated as though I had no reason to be angry. The deposit is a huge part of a house hold income & was not given a timeline on the return as I was not given COMMON COURTESY of communicating their inability to move me in on DEC 20.

I am rejecting this response because: No one kicked my door in first of all. My  door never needed replaced only the frame. The last person that fixed my door SAID “The property manager will be coming to fix the rest of your door.” 2 Months ago! I’ve contacted You more than once about my door by phone.  You gave me a price and I PAID IT. Simple as that. Maintenance told me they had to order parts for my door and they couldn’t until I paid $250.  I paid March 11,2022 parts was supposed to be here and my door was supposed to been done.

It was not that way when you moved in. If it was vandalism, you should have called the police , made a report and turned over to your renters insurance for repair costs. This was not done. We only charged you the cost of the door replacement, trying to be nice. We did not charge you for the labor of hiring a company to come in and replace the door. All charges will be assessed once the repairs are completed.",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/chattanooga/profile/apartments/courts-at-waterford-place-0483-31000023

Advertising/Sales Issues,1424905505,Resolved,12/02/2020,Business response,"Business Response /* (1000, 5, 2020/11/16) */ Mr. ** signed a lease that required him to give a 60 day notice. He have notice on June 26, 2020. He moved out July 9, 2020. he was charged for the balance of the 60 day notice that he did not fulfill according to the terms of his lease Consumer Response /* (3000, 8, 2020/11/16) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) No balance was posted on the account until after a collections had been placed. The date of move out the balance that was listed was paid in full and no other balances were listed until months after move out ( we found the balance via a collections account on a credit report). Your company did not provide any type of explanation regarding the information requested. Your company did not notify me of this balance ( I had checked my account numerous times after move out and this is months). No information was sent regarding the placement of a collections account either. Your management has been nothing short of inappropriate and disappointing. Business Response /* (4000, 10, 2020/11/16) */ I have the contract he signed requiring a 60 day notice. He did not abide by the contract he signed. It is a legal binding contract. he is responsible for the charges that would only have been added if he did not fulfill the notice. Those charges could ONLY be added once he moved out. It would be impossible to know how many days he was short of the REQUIRED 60 days until he moved. Consumer Response /* (3000, 13, 2020/11/19) */ The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) As stated before, the information requested has not been answered. The amount has been paid in full. I'm wondering why this balance was only seen after a collections was placed. AS STATED BEFORE, I had checked the account for weeks and months after move out and no balance was ever listed. No collections information was ever received (you have my permanent address information listed on my drivers license I did not receive any notice of the potential for this to be sent to a collections agency. I did not see this balance information until I had a credit report check and there was information regarding a collections account and when finally logging into my account SUPPOSEDLY the balance was placed on the exact same day of move out. THE BALANCE WAS NEVER ON THE ACCOUNT UNTIL AFTER A COLLECTIONS WAS PLACED. Because of your businesses lack of responsibility for communication I want this collections account removed from my credit. I have taken responsibility for my part and I expect the same from your business. Business Response /* (4000, 15, 2020/11/20) */ I could not add the 60 day notice amount until after he moved out. No way to know how many days existed until he turned in keys. I DON'T CARE IF HE ACCEPTS OR NOT. HE SIGNED THE CONTRACT AND IS BOUND BY IT'S TERMS. WE WILL GO TO COURT IF NECESSARY. THE CONTRACT HE SIGNED WILL HOLD. This is not about how someone feels or whether they disagree. HE SIGNED A CONTRACT. Consumer Response /* (3000, 18, 2020/11/24) */ (The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT accept the response from the business.) I don't accept this response. I have no idea what the company is talking about as far as ""feels"" I just want this removed from my report. You are now threatening me over a debt that has already been paid in full, 1,113 . I have email receipt to show proof of payment over a week ago. At this point I just need to know, will the company start the process and have this removed or if I need to go through the collection agency to inform them the amount has been paid to your company ? Business Response /* (4000, 20, 2020/12/01) */ The collection agency has been informed that the debt has been paid Consumer Response /* (2000, 22, 2020/12/01) */ (The consumer indicated he/she ACCEPTED the response from the business.)",https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/chattanooga/profile/apartments/courts-at-waterford-place-0483-31000023
Problems with Product/Service,1304387016,Unanswered,08/03/2022,Initial Complaint,"I recently applied for the town home apartment and paid the application fee for $50.00 on July 6, 2022. I then received a call from the Assitant Mgr. on July 8 stating that I was approved for the apartment however, it was not ready for viewing to actually see. I was also advised that there was no deposit however, a non-refundable fee of $250.00 to secure the place is needed and I needed to go through the weblink that will be sent to me. I was also advised that I need to click on the weblink within 24 hrs to pay $250.00 to secure the place. I went to the https://appfol.io/Wjank5 website and it came up as ATM Group, I was only expecting to pay the $250.00 however I was charged $750.00 instead and I could not pay a lessor amount to go forward to set up the account. Since this I made the payment on a weekend I did not speak to anyone until the next week. When I spoke to the Mgr. she stated the $750.00 was the fee due to me not initially getting approved but she over rided the approval process before consulting me and pushed me through. At this point I was frustrated but was still trying to see what are my remaining fees that will be due and she stated I will have to wait on the welcome letter in which I did not receive or hear from the company until July 21, 2022. At this point I got another job that requires me to go to another state and I asked for the $500.00 back and not the $250 that was non refundable. I also let the Mgr. know that I have a Govenment job and I will be relocating and I have not initially signed a lease and would like a refund. However, I have not heard from the Mgr, or the regional Mgr. of the company to discuss a partial refund or least provide something that a lease cannot be broken before seeing or signing the official lease. BBB can you please assist, because if this company is treating me this way before I move in I wonder how they are treating the actual tenets.
